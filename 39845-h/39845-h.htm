<h2>Preface</h2>


<p>This little book was written nearly a quarter of a
century ago in the enthusiasm of a first acquaintance
with a fascinating subject, and with an honest endeavour
to see for myself as many as possible of the
books I set out to describe. If I had tried to rewrite
it now I might have made it more interesting to
experts, but at the cost of destroying whatever merit
it possesses as an introductory sketch. I have therefore
been content to correct, as thoroughly as I could,
its many small errors (not all of my own making),
more especially those due to the ascription of books
to impossible dates and printers, which before the
publication of Robert Proctor's <i>Index to the Early
Printed Books in the British Museum</i>, in 1898, was
very difficult to avoid. In these emendations, and
in getting the titles of foreign books into better
form, I have had much kind help from Mr. Victor
Scholderer of the British Museum. I am grateful
also to Mr. E. Gordon Duff for his leave to use again
the chapter on English Illustrated Books which he
kindly wrote for me for the first edition.</p>

<h3>RUBRISHERS AND ILLUMINATORS</h3>


<p>No point in the history of printing has been more
rightly insisted on than that the early printers were
compelled to make the very utmost of their new
art in order to justify its right to exist. When a
generation had passed by, when the scribes trained
in the first half of the fifteenth century had died
or given up the struggle, when printing-presses had
invaded the very monasteries themselves, and clever
boys no longer regarded penmanship as a possible
profession, then, but not till then, printers could
afford to be careless, and speedily began to avail
themselves of their new license. In the early days
of the art no such license was possible, and the
striking similarity in the appearance of the printed
books and manuscripts produced contemporaneously
in any given city or district, is the best possible
proof of the success with which the early printers
competed with the most expert of the professional
scribes.</p>

<p>All this is trite enough, but we are somewhat less<!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
frequently reminded that, after some magnificent
experiments by Fust and Schoeffer at Mainz, the
earliest printers deliberately elected to do battle at
first with the scribes alone, and that in the fifteenth
century the scribes were very far, indeed, from
being the only persons engaged in the production
of books. The subdivision of labour is not by any
means a modern invention; on the contrary, it
is impossible to read a list of the medieval guilds
in any important town without being struck with
the minuteness of the sections into which some
apparently quite simple callings were split up. Of
this subdivision of labour, the complex art of book-production
was naturally an instance. For a proof
of this, we need go no further than the records of the
Guild of St. John the Evangelist at Bruges, in which,
according to Mr. Blades's quotation of the extracts
made by Van Praet, members of at least fourteen
branches of industry connected with the manufacture
of books joined together for common objects.
In the fifteenth century a book of devotions, commissioned
by some wealthy book-lover, such as the
Duke of Bedford, might be written by one man, have
its rubrics supplied by another, its small initial
letters and borders by a third, and then be sent to
some famous miniaturist in France or Flanders for
final completion. The scribe only supplied the
groundwork, all the rest was added by other hands,
and it was only with the scribe that the early
printers competed.<!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The restriction of their efforts to competition with
the scribe alone, was not accepted by the first little
group of printers until after some fairly exhaustive
experiments. The interesting trial leaves, preserved
in some copies of the 42-line Bible, differ from the
rest not only in having their text compressed into
two lines less, but also in having the rubrics printed
instead of filled in by hand. Printing in two colours
still involves much extra labour, and it was easier
to supply the rubric by hand than to be at the pains
of a second impression, even if this could be effected
by the comparatively simple process of stamping.
Except, therefore, in the trial leaves, the rubrics of
the first Bible are all in manuscript. Peter Schoeffer,
however, when he joined with the goldsmith
Fust in the production of the magnificent Mainz
<i>Psalter</i> of 1457, was not content to rely on the
help of illuminators for his rubrics and capitals,
or, as the disuse of the word majuscules makes it
convenient to call them, initial letters. Accordingly,
the Psalter appeared not only with printed
rubrics, but with the magnificent B at the head of
the first psalm, which has so often been copied, and
some two hundred and eighty smaller initials,
printed in blue and red.</p>

<p>Schoeffer's initial letters appear again in two
editions of the <i>Canon of the Mass</i> attributed to
1458, in the <i>Psalter</i> of 1459, in the <i>Rationale</i> of
Durandus of the same year, and in a <i>Donatus</i>
printed in the type of the 1462 Bible. As Mr.<!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Duff has pointed out, in some sheets of this Bible
itself the red initial letters are printed and the outline
of the blue ones impressed in blank for the guidance
of the illuminator in filling them in. Thereafter
Schoeffer seems to have kept his initials for
special occasions, as in the 35-line <i>Donatus</i> issued
<i>c.</i> 1468, perhaps when he was starting business for
himself, and in the antiquarian reprints of the
<i>Psalter</i> in and after 1490. Doubtless he was sorry
when he could no longer print in the colophon of
a book that it was 'venustate capitalium decoratus,
rubricationibusque sufficienter distinctus,' but while
illuminators were still plentiful, handwork was
probably the least expensive process of decoration.
It is noteworthy, also, that Mr. Duff's discovery as
regards the 1462 Bible brings us down to the beginning
of those troublous three years in the history of
Mainz, during which Fust and Schoeffer only printed
'Bulls and other such ephemeral publications.'
When they resumed the printing of important
works in 1465 with the <i>Decretals</i> of Boniface VIII.
and the <i>De Officiis</i> of Cicero, Schoeffer was content
to leave decoration to the illuminator. The firm's
expenses were thus diminished, and purchasers
were able to economise in the amount of decoration
bestowed upon the copy they were buying. It is
noteworthy, indeed, that even in 1459, when he
was habitually using his printed initial letters,
Schoeffer did not refuse customers this liberty, for
while one of the copies of the <i>Rationale Durandi</i> at<!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the Bibliothèque Nationale has the initials printed,
in the others they are illuminated by hand.</p>

<p>Very little attention has as yet been devoted to
the study of the illumination and rubrication of
printed books, and much patient investigation will
be needed before we can attain any real knowledge
of the relation of the illuminators to the early
printers. Professor Middleton, in his work on
<i>Illuminated Manuscripts</i>, had something to say on
the subject, but the pretty little picture he drew of
a scene in Gutenberg's (?) shop seems to have been
rather hastily arrived at. 'The workshop,' he
wrote, 'of an early printer included not only compositors
and printers, but also cutters and founders
of type, illuminators of borders and initials, and
skilful binders, who could cover books with various
qualities and kinds of binding. A purchaser in
Gutenberg's shop, for example, of his magnificent
Bible in loose sheets, would then have been asked
what style of illumination he was prepared to pay
for, and then what kind of binding, and how many
brass bosses and clasps he wished to have.' What
evidence there is on the subject hardly favours
the theory which Professor Middleton thus boldly
stated as a fact. The names we know in connection
with the decoration of the 42-line Bible are those of
Heinrich Cremer, vicar of the Church of St. Stephen
at Mainz, who rubricated, illuminated, and bound
the paper copy now in the Bibliothèque Nationale,
and Johann Fogel, a well-known binder of the time,<!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
whose stamps are found on no fewer than three of
the extant copies of this Bible. We have no
reason to believe that either Cremer or Fogel was
employed in the printer's shop, so that as regards
the particular book which he instances, it is hard
to see on what ground Professor Middleton built
his assertion.</p>

<p>As regards Schoeffer's practice after 1462, the
evidence certainly points to the majority of his
books having been rubricated before they left his
hands, but the variety of the styles in the copies I
have seen, especially in those on vellum, forbids
my believing that they were all illuminated in a
single workshop. A copy in the British Museum
of his 1471 edition of the <i>Constitutions</i> of Pope
Clement <span class="smcap">V.</span> presents us with an instance, rather
uncommon in a printed book, though not infrequently
found in manuscripts, of an elaborate
border and miniatures, sketched out in pencil and
prepared for gilding, but never completed. The
book could hardly have been sold in this condition,
and would not have been returned so from any
illuminator's workshop. We must conjecture that
it was sold unilluminated to some monastery, where
its decoration was begun by one of the monks, but
put aside for some cause, and never finished.</p>

<p>The utmost on this subject that we can say at
present is that as a printer would depend for the sale
of his books in the first place on the inhabitants of
the town in which he printed, and as these would be<!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
most likely to employ an illuminator from the same
place, the predominant style of decoration in any
book is likely to be that of the district in which it
was printed, and if we find the same style predominant
in a number of books this may give us a clue
to connect them altogether, or to distinguish them
from some other group. In this way, for instance, it
is possible that some light may be thrown on the
question whether the 36-line Bible was finished at
Bamberg or at Mainz. Certainly the clumsy, heavy
initials in the British Museum copy are very unlike
those which occur in Mainz books, and if this style
were found to predominate in other copies we should
have an important piece of new evidence on a much
debated question. But our knowledge that Schoeffer
had an agency for the sale of his books as far off
from the place of their printing as Paris, the Italian
character of the illuminations added to some of his
books, and the occurrence of a note in a book printed
in Italy that the purchaser could not wait to have
it illuminated there, but entrusted it to a German
artist on his return home, may suffice to warn us
against any rash conclusion in the present very
meagre state of our knowledge.</p>

<p>Apart from the question as to where they were
executed, the illuminations in books printed in Germany
are not, as a rule, very interesting. Germany
was not the home of fine manuscripts during the
fifteenth century, and her printed books depend for
their beauty on the rich effect of their gothic types,<!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
their good paper and handsome margins, rather
than on the accessories added by hand. The attempts
of the more ambitious miniaturists to depict,
within the limits of an initial, St. Jerome translating
the Bible or David playing on the harp, are, for the
most part, clumsy and ill-drawn. On the other
hand, fairly good scroll-work of flowers and birds
is not uncommon. As a rule it surrounds the whole
page of text, but in some cases an excellent effect
is produced by the stem of the design being brought
up between the two columns of a large page, branching
out at either end so as to cover the upper and
lower margins, those at the sides being left bare. It
may be mentioned that much good scroll-work is
found on paper copies, the vellum used in early
German books being usually coarse and brown, and
sometimes showing the imperfections of the skin by
holes as large as a filbert, so that it was employed
apparently, chiefly for its greater resistance to wear
and tear, rather than as a luxurious refinement,
as was the case in Italy and France. An extreme
instance of the superiority of a paper copy to one
on vellum may be found by comparing the coarsely-rubricated
42-line Bible in the Grenville Collection
at the British Museum with the very prettily
illuminated copy of the same book in the King's
Library. The Grenville copy is on vellum, the
King's on paper; but my own preference has always
been for the latter. Even in Germany, however,
good vellum books were sometimes produced, for<!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the printers endeavoured to match the skins fairly
uniformly throughout a volume, and a book-lover
of taste would not be slow to pick out the best copy.
The finest German vellum book with which I am
acquainted is the Lamoignon copy of the 1462 Bible,
now in the British Museum. This was specially
illuminated for a certain Conradus Dolea, whose
name and initials are introduced into the lower
border on the first page of the second volume. The
scroll-work is excellent, and the majority of the large
initials are wisely restricted to simple decorative
designs. Only in a few cases, as at the beginning
of the Psalms, where David is as usual playing his
harp, is the general good taste which marks the
volume disturbed by clumsy figure-work.</p>

<p>In turning from the illuminations of the first
German books to those printed by Jenson and
Vindelinus de Spira at Venice we are confronted
with an interesting discovery, first noted by the
Vicomte Delaborde in his delightful book <i>La Gravure
en Italie avant Marc-Antoine</i> (p. 252), carried a
little further in the <i>Bibliographie des Livres à figures
Venitiens</i>, written by the Prince d'Essling when he
was Duc de Rivoli, then greatly extended by the
researches of Dr. Paul Kristeller, some of the results
of which, when as yet unpublished, he kindly communicated
to me, and finally summed up in the
Prince d'Essling's magnificent work, <i>Les Livres à
figures Venitiens</i>. In a considerable number&mdash;the list
given me by Dr. Kristeller enumerated about forty&mdash;of<!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the works published by Jenson and Vindelinus,
from 1469 to 1473, the work of the illuminator has
been facilitated in some copies by the whole or a
portion of his design having been first stamped for
him from a block. The evidence of this stamping
is partly in the dent made in the paper or vellum,
partly in the numerous little breaks in the lines
where the block has not retained the ink; but I was
myself lucky enough to find in the Grenville copy
of the <i>Virgil</i> printed at Venice by Bartholomaeus
de Cremona in 1472, an uncoloured example of this
stamped work, which was reproduced in <i>Bibliographica</i>,
and subsequently by the Prince d'Essling.
A copy of the <i>Pliny</i> of 1469 in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, illuminated by means of this device, has
an upper and inner border of the familiar white
elliptical interlacements on a gold and green ground.
In the centre of the lower border is a shield supported
by two children, and at the feet of each child
is a rabbit. The outer border shows two cornucopias
on a green and gold ground. The upper and
inner borders are repeated again in the <i>Livy</i> and
<i>Virgil</i> of 1470, in the <i>Valerius Maximus</i> of 1471, and
in the <i>Rhetorica</i> of George of Trebizond of 1472. In
this last book it is joined with another border, first
found in the <i>De Officiis</i> of Cicero of the same year.
All these books proceeded from the press of Johannes
and Vindelinus de Spira. A quite distinct set of
borders are found in Jenson's edition of Cicero's
<i>Epistolae ad Familiares</i> of 1471; but in an article<!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in the <i>Archivio Storico delle Arti</i> Dr. Kristeller
showed that the lower border of the <i>Pliny</i> of 1469,
described above, occurs again in a copy of the <i>De
Evangelica Praeparatione</i>, printed by Jenson in 1470.
The apparent distinction of the blocks used in the
books of the two firms is thus broken down, and
in face of the rarity of the copies thus decorated
in comparison with those illuminated by hand, or
which have come down to us with their blank spaces
still unfilled, it seems impossible to maintain that
either the preliminary engraving or the illumination
was done in the printer's workshop. We should
rather regard the engraving as a labour-saving device
employed by some master illuminator to whom
private purchasers sent the books they had purchased
from the De Spiras or Jenson for decoration.
No instance has as yet been found of a book printed
after 1473 being illuminated in this way.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Apart from the special interest of these particular
borders, the illumination in early Italian books is
almost uniformly graceful and beautiful. Interlacements,
oftenest of white upon blue, sometimes of
gold upon green, are the form of ornament most
commonly met with. Still prettier than these are<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the floral borders, tapering off into little stars of
gold. Elaborate architectural designs are also
found, but these, as a rule, are much less pleasing.
In the majority of the borders of all three classes a
shield, of the graceful Italian shape, is usually introduced,
sometimes left blank, sometimes filled in
with the arms of the owner. More often than not
this shield is enclosed in a circle of green bay leaves.
The initial letters are, as a rule, purely decorative,
the designs harmonising with the borders. In some
instances they consist simply of a large letter in red
or blue, without any surrounding scroll-work. We
must also note that in some copies of books from
the presses of the German printers at Rome we
find large initial letters in red and blue, distinctly
German in their design, the work, possibly, of the
printers themselves.</p>

<p>Germany and Italy are the only two countries
in which illumination plays an important part in
the decoration of early books. In England, where
the Wars of the Roses had checked the development
of a very promising native school of illuminators,
the use of colour in printed books is almost
unknown. The early issues from Caxton's press,
before he began to employ printed initials, are either
left with their blanks unfilled, or rubricated in the
plainest possible manner. In France, the scholastic
objects of the press at the Sorbonne, and the few
resources of the printers who succeeded it during
the next seven or eight years, at first forbade any<!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
serious competition with the splendid manuscripts
which were then being produced. In Holland and
Spain woodcut initials, which practically gave the
death-blow to illumination as a necessary adjunct
of a book, were introduced almost simultaneously
with the use of type.</p>

<p>So far we have considered illumination merely as a
means of completing in a not immoderately expensive
manner the blanks left by the earliest printers. We
may devote a few pages to glancing at the subsequent
application of the art to the decoration of
special copies intended for presentation to a patron,
or commissioned by a wealthy book-lover. The
preparation of such copies was practically confined
to France and Italy. A copy on vellum of the Great
Bible of 1540, presented to Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> by his
'loving, faithfull and obedient subject and daylye
oratour, Anthony Marler of London, Haberdassher,'
has the elaborate woodcut title-page carefully
painted over by hand, but this is almost the only
English book of which I can think in which colour
was thus employed. In Germany its use was only
too common, but for popular, not for artistic work,
for at least two out of every three early German
books with woodcut illustrations have the cuts
garishly painted over in the rudest possible manner,
to the great defacement of the outlines, which we
would far rather see unobscured. It is tempting,
indeed, to believe that in many cases this deplorable
addition must have been the work of the 'domestic'<!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
artist; it is certainly rare to find an instance
in which it in any way improves the underlying
cut.</p>

<p>In France and Italy, on the other hand, the early
printers were confronted by many wealthy book-lovers,
accustomed to manuscripts adorned with
every possible magnificence, and in a few instances
they found it worth while to cater for their tastes.
For this purpose they employed the most delicate
vellum (very unlike the coarse material used by the
Germans for its strength) decorating the margins
with elaborate borders, and sometimes prefixing a
coloured frontispiece. In France this practice was
begun by Guillaume Fichet and Jean Heynlyn, the
managers of the press at the Sorbonne. Several
magnificent copies of early Sorbonne books&mdash;so
sober in their ordinary dress&mdash;are still extant, to
which Fichet has prefixed a large miniature representing
himself in his clerical garb presenting a copy
of the book to the Pope, to our own Edward <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, to
Cardinal Bessarion, or to other patrons. In some
cases he also prefixed a specially printed letter of
dedication, thereby rendering the copy absolutely
unique. Some twenty years later this practice of
preparing special copies for wealthy patrons was
resumed by Antoine Vérard, whose enterprise has
bequeathed to the Bibliothèque Nationale a whole
row of books thus specially decorated for Charles
<span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, and to the British Museum a no less splendid
set commissioned by Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> Nor were Vérard's<!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
patrons only found among kings, for a record still
exists of four books thus ornamented by him for
Charles d'Angoulême, at a total cost of over two
hundred livres, equivalent to rather more than the
same number of pounds sterling of our present
money.</p>

<p>Vérard's methods of preparing these magnificent
volumes were neither very artistic nor very honest.
The miniatures are thickly painted, so that an
underlying woodcut, on quite a different subject,
was sometimes utilised to furnish the artist with
an idea for the grouping of the figures. Thus a cut
from Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>, representing Saturn
devouring his children and a very unpleasing figure
of Venus rising from the sea, was converted into a
Holy Family by painting out the Venus and reducing
Saturn's cannibal embrace to an affectionate
fondling. This process of alteration and painting
out was also employed by Vérard to conceal the fact
that these splendid copies were often not of his own
publication, but commissioned by him from other
publishers. Thus Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>'s copy of <i>L'Examen de
Conscience</i> has the colophon, in which it is stated
to have been printed for Pierre Regnault of
Rouen, rather carelessly erased, and in Charles
<span class="smcap">VIII.</span>'s copy of the <i>Compost et Kalendrier des
Bergers</i> (1493)<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Guiot Marchant's device has been<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
concealed by painting over it the royal arms, while
the colophon in which his name appears has been
partly erased, partly covered over by a painted
copy of Vérard's well-known device. Vérard's
borders, also, are as a rule heavy, consisting
chiefly of flowers and arabesques arranged in
clumsy squares or lozenges. Altogether these
princely volumes are perhaps rather magnificent
than in good taste.</p>

<p>The custom of illuminating the cuts in vellum
books was not practised only by Vérard. Almost all
the French publishers of Books of Hours resorted to
it&mdash;at first, while the illumination was carefully done,
with very splendid effect, afterwards to the utter
ruin of the beautiful designs which the colour concealed.
Under Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> illumination seems to
have revived, for we hear of a vellum copy of the <i>De
Philologia</i> of Budæus, printed by Ascensius (1532),
having its first page of text enclosed in a rich border
in which appear the arms of the dukes of Orleans
and Angoulême to whom it was dedicated. In
another work by Budæus (himself a book-lover as
well as a scholar), the <i>De Transitu Hellenismi</i>,
printed by Robert Estienne in 1535, the portrait and
arms of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> are enclosed in another richly
illuminated border, and the King's arms are painted
in other books printed about this time. In a vellum
copy of a French Bible printed by Jean de Tournes
at Lyons in 1557, there are over three hundred
miniatures, and borders to every page. Even by<!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the middle of the seventeenth century the use of
illumination had not quite died out in France,
though it adds nothing to the beauty of the tasteless
works then issued from the French presses. One
of the latest instances in which I have encountered
it is in a copy presented to Louis <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> of <i>La Lyre du
Jeune Apollon, ou la Muse naissante du Petit de
Beauchasteau</i> (Paris, 1657); in this the half-title is
surrounded by a wreath of gold, and surmounted
by a lyre, the title is picked out in red, blue, and
gold, and the headpieces and tailpieces throughout
the volume are daubed over with colour. By the
expenditure of a vast amount of pains, a dull book
is thus rendered both pretentious and offensive.</p>

<p>In Italy, the difference between ordinary copies of
early books and specially prepared ones, is bridged
over by so many intermediate stages of decoration
that we are obliged to confine our attention to one or
two famous examples of sumptuous books. The
Italian version of <i>Pliny</i>, made by Cristoforo Landino
and printed by Jenson in 1476, exists in such a form
as one of the Douce books (No. 310) in the Bodleian
Library. This copy has superb borders at the beginning
of each book, and is variously supposed to
have been prepared for Ferdinand <span class="smcap">II.</span>, King of
Naples, and for a member of the Strozzi family of
Florence, the arms of both being frequently introduced
into the decoration. Still more superb are
the three vellum copies of Giovanni Simoneta's
<i>Historia delle cose facte dallo invictissimo Duca Francesco
Sforza</i>,<!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> translated (like the <i>Pliny</i>) by Cristoforo
Landino, and printed by Antonio Zarotto at Milan
in 1490. These copies were prepared for members
of the Sforza family, portraits of whom are introduced
in the borders. The decoration is florid, but
superb of its kind, and provoked Dibdin to record
his admiration of the copy now in the Grenville
Library as 'one of the loveliest of membranaceous
jewels' it had ever been his fortune to meet with.
For many years in a case devoted to specimens of
illuminated printed books in the King's Library the
British Museum used to exhibit vellum copies of
the Aldine <i>Martial</i> of 1501, and <i>Catullus</i> of 1502,
and side by side with them, printed respectively
just twelve years later, and also on vellum, an <i>Aulus
Gellius</i> and <i>Plautus</i> presented by Giunta, the Florentine
rival of Aldus, to the younger Lorenzo de'
Medici.</p>

<p>The use of illumination in printed books was a
natural and pleasing survival of the glories of the
illuminated manuscript. Its discontinuance was in
part a sign of health as testifying to the increased
resources of the printing press; in part a symptom
of the carelessness as to the form of books which by
the end of the seventeenth century had become well-nigh
universal throughout Europe. So long as a
few rich amateurs cared for copies of their favourite
authors printed on vellum, and decorated by the
hands of skilful artists, a high standard of excellence
was set up which influenced the whole of the<!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><!-- Page 19 --><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>
book-trade, and for this reason the revival of the use
of vellum in our own day may perhaps be welcomed.
It may be noted that the especially Italian custom
of introducing the arms of the owner into the
majority of illuminated designs left its trace in the
blank shields which so frequently form the centre
of the printed borders in Italian books from 1490 to
1520. Theoretically these shields were intended to
be filled in with the owner's arms in colour, but they
are more often found blank. Two examples of
their use are here shown, one from the upper border
of the <i>Calendar</i>, printed at Venice in 1476 (the first
book with an ornamental title-page), the other from
the lower border of the first page of text of the
<i>Trabisonda Istoriata</i>, printed also at Venice in 1494.
We may note also that the parallel custom of inserting
the arms of the patron to whom a book was
dedicated was carried on in Spain in a long series
of title-pages, in which the arms of the patron form
the principal feature.</p>

<span class="caption">From <i>La Trabisonda Historiata</i> of 1494.</span>
</div>

<p>In England, also, a patron's coat was sometimes
printed as one of the decorations of a book. Thus on
the third leaf of the first edition of the <i>Golden Legend</i>
there is a large woodcut of a horse galloping past a
tree, the device of the Earl of Arundel, the patron
to whom Caxton owed his yearly fee of a buck in
summer and a doe in winter. So, too, in the Morton
<i>Missal</i>, printed by Pynson in 1500, the Morton arms
occupy a full page at the beginning of the book.
Under Elizabeth and James <span class="smcap">I.</span> the practice became<!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
fairly common. In some cases where the leaf thus
decorated has become detached, the arms have all
the appearance of an early book-plate, and the
Bagford example of Sir Nicholas Bacon's plate
has endured suspicions on this account. In this
instance, however, the fortunate existence of a
slight flaw in the block, which occurs also in the
undoubtedly genuine gift-plate of 1574, offers a
strong argument in favour of its having been in
the possession of Sir Nicholas himself, and therefore
presumably used by him as a mark of possession.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In a copy of the edition of <i>Suetonius</i>, printed by Sweynheym and
Pannartz at Rome in 1470, which belonged to William Morris, and
is now in the Morgan collection at New York, there are nine excellent
woodcut capitals used with a handsome border-piece, which do not
appear in other examples. Dr. Lippmann found similar decorations in
the 1465 edition of <i>Lactantius</i>, printed at Subiaco by the same firm.
In this case the blocks probably belonged to the printers, but were
used to decorate only a few copies.</p></div>

<h3>THE COMPLETION OF THE PRINTED BOOK</h3>


<p>As we have seen, the typical book during the first
quarter of a century of the history of printing is one
in which the printer supplied the place of the scribe
and of the scribe alone. An appreciable, though not
a very large, percentage of early books have come
down to us in the exact state in which they issued
from the press, with a blank space at their beginning
for an illumination, blanks for the initial letters,
blanks for the chapter headings, no head-lines, no
title-page, no pagination, and no signatures to guide
the binder in arranging the sheets in the different
gatherings. Our task in the present chapter is to
trace briefly the history of the emancipation of the
printer from his dependence on handwork for the
completion of his books. We shall not expect to
find this emancipation effected step by step in
any orderly progression. Innovations, the utility of
which seems to us obvious and striking, occur as if
by hazard in an isolated book, are then abandoned
even by the printer who started them, and subsequently
reappear in a number of books printed about
the same time at different places, so that it is impossible
to fix the chronology of the revived fashion.<!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>We have already noted how the anxiety of the
earliest Mainz printers to rival at the very outset
the best manuscripts with which they were acquainted,
led them to anticipate improvements
which were not generally adopted till many years
afterwards. Among these we must not reckon the<!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
use for the rubrics or chapter headings of red ink,
which appears in the trial leaves of the 42-line Bible,
and was to a greater or less extent employed by
Schoeffer in most of his books. Although red ink has
appeared sporadically, and still does so, on the title-page
of a book here or there, more especially on those
which make some pretence to sumptuousness, its use
in the fifteenth century was a survival, not an anticipation.
For legal and liturgical works it was long
considered essential; for other books the expense of
the double printing which it involves soon brought
it into disfavour and has kept it there ever since.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;">
<a href="images/i_032.jpg"><img src="images/i_032_tn.jpg" width="359" height="400"
alt="example use of red ink and shield device printer's mark in the appendix to the colophon of Shoeffer's Bible of 1642"
title="linked to larger image" /></a>
</div>

<p>The use of a colophon, or crowning paragraph,
at the end of a book, to give the information now
contained on our title-pages, dates from the Mainz
Psalter of 1457, and was continued by Schoeffer in
most of his books. A colophon occurs also in the
<i>Catholicon</i> of 1460, though it does not mention the
printer's name (almost certainly Gutenberg). There
is an admirably full one in rhyming couplets (set out
as prose) to Pfister's <i>Buch der vier Historien von
Joseph, Daniel, Esther, und Judith</i>, and the brothers
Bechtermüntze, who printed the <i>Vocabularius ex
quo</i> at Eltvil in 1467, are equally explicit. In many
cases, however, no colophon of any sort appears, and
the year and place of publication have to be deduced
from the information given in other books printed
in the same types, or from the chance entry by a
purchaser or rubricator of the date at which the
book came into or left his hands. We may claim<!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
colophons as part of the subject of this book, because
they early received decorative treatment.
Schoeffer prints them, as a rule, in his favourite red
ink, and it was as an appendix to the colophon that
the printer's device first made its appearance.
Schoeffer's well-known shields occur in this connection
in his Bible of 1462. No other instance of a
device is known until about 1470, when they became
common, some printers, like Arnold ther Hoernen
of Cologne, and Colard Mansion of Bruges, imitating
Schoeffer in the modest size of their badges, while
others, among whom some Dutch printers are prominent,
made their emblem large enough, if need
be, to decorate a whole page.</p>

<p>Of Schoeffer's coloured capitals enough has
already been said. Woodcut initials for printing
in outline, the outline being intended to be coloured
by hand, were used by Günther Zainer at Augsburg
at least as early as 1471, and involved him in a controversy
to which we shall allude in our next chapter.
Their use spread slowly, for it was about this date
that the employment of hand-painted initials was
given a fresh lease of life, by the introduction of the
printed 'director,' or small letter, indicating to the
illuminator the initial he was required to supply.
The director had been used by the scribes, and in
early printed books is frequently found in manuscript.
It was, of course, intended to be painted
over, but the rubrication of printed books was so
carelessly executed that it often appears in the open<!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
centre of the coloured letter. In so far as it delayed
the introduction of woodcut letters, this ingenious
device was a step backward rather than an improvement.</p>

<p>In the order of introduction, the next addition to
a printer's stock-in-trade which we have to chronicle
is the use of woodcut illustrations. These were
first employed by Albrecht Pfister, who in 1461 was
printing at Bamberg. Like Schoeffer's coloured
initials, Pfister's illustrated books form an incident
apart from the general history of the development of
the printed book, and it will be convenient, therefore,
to give them a brief notice here, rather than to place
them at the head of our next chapter. They are
six in number, or, if we count different editions
separately, nine, of which only two have dates,
viz.: one of the two editions of Boner's <i>Edelstein</i>,
dated 1461, and the <i>Buch der vier Historien von
Joseph, Daniel, Esther, und Judith</i>, dated 1462,
with Pfister's name in the rhyming colophon already
alluded to. The undated books are another edition
of the <i>Edelstein</i>; the <i>Belial seu consolatio
peccatorum</i>; a <i>Biblia Pauperum</i>; two closely
similar editions of this in German; two editions of
the <i>Rechtstreit des Menschen mit dem Tode</i>, also
called <i>Gespräch zwischen einem Wittwer und dem
Tode</i>. Attention was first drawn to these books
by the Pastor Jacob August Steiner of Augsburg in
1792, and when the volume which he described was
brought to the Bibliothèque Nationale, with other<!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
spoils from Germany, a learned Frenchman, Camus,
read a paper on them before the Institute in 1799.
The three tracts which the volume contained were
restored to the library at Wolfenbüttel in 1815,
but the Bibliothèque has since acquired another set
of three and a separate edition of the German <i>Biblia
Pauperum</i>. The only other copies known are those
in the Spencer Collection, one of the <i>Belial</i> at
Nuremberg, and a unique example of the undated
<i>Edelstein</i> at Berlin.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>These four books contain altogether no less than
201 cuts, executed in clumsy outline. One hundred
and one of these cuts belong to the <i>Edelstein</i>, a
collection of German fables written before 1330.
The book which contains them is a small folio of
28 leaves, and with a width of page larger by a fourth
than the size of the cuts. To fill this gap, Pfister
introduced on the left of the illustration a figure of
a man. In the dated copy, in which the cuts are
more worn, this figure is the same throughout the
book; in the undated there are differences in the
man's headgear, and in the book or tablet he is
holding, constituting three different variations. In
the <i>Buch der vier Historien</i> the cuts number 55, six
of which, however, are repeated, making 61 impressions.
In the impossibility of obtaining access to
the originals, while the Spencer Collection was in
the course of removal, the careful copy of one of
these, made for Camus in 1799, was chosen for repro<!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>duction
as likely to be less familiar than the illustrations
from Pfister's other books given by Dibdin
in his <i>Bibliotheca Spenceriana</i>. The subject is the
solemn sacrifice of a lamb at Bethulia after Judith's
murder of Holofernes. The <i>Biblia Pauperum</i> is in
three editions, two in German, the third in Latin;
each consists of 17 printed leaves, with a large cut
formed of five separate blocks illustrating different
subjects, but joined together as a whole, on each
page.</p>

<p>The last book of Pfister's we have to notice, the
<i>Complaint of the Widower against Death</i>, is probably
earlier than either of his dated ones. It contains
24 leaves, with five full-page cuts, showing (1) Death
on his throne, and the widower and his little son in
mourning; (2) Death and the widower, with a pope,
a noble, and a monk vainly offering Death gold; (3)
two figures of Death (one mounted) pursuing their
victims; (4) Death on his throne, with two lower
compartments representing monks at a cloister gate,
and women walking with a child in a fair garden,&mdash;this
to symbolise the widower's choice between
remarriage and retiring to a monastery; (5) the
widower appearing before Christ, who gives the
verdict against him, since all mortals must yield
their bodies to Death and their souls to God. The
cuts in this book are larger and bolder than the
other specimens of Pfister's work which we have
noticed, but they are rude enough.</p>

</div>

<p>After the introduction of woodcut illustrations,<!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the next innovation with which we have to concern
ourselves is the adoption of the title-page. What
may be called accidental title-pages are found on
both the Latin and the German edition of a Bull of
Pope Pius <span class="smcap">II.</span> printed by Fust and Schoeffer in 1463.
After this Arnold ther Hoernen of Cologne appears
to have been the first printer lavish enough to devote
a whole page to prefixing a title to a book. A
facsimile is here given, from which we see that this
'sermon preachable on the feast of the presentation
of the most blessed Virgin' was printed in 1470 at
the outset of ther Hoernen's career. The printer,
however, seems to have understood no better than
Schoeffer the commercial advantage of what he
was doing, and the next title-page which has to
be chronicled is another of the same kind, reading
the 'Tractatulus compendiosus per modum dyalogi
timidis | ac deuotis viris editus instruens non plus
curam | de pullis et carnibus habere suillis quam
quo modo | verus deus et homo qui in celis est digne
tractetur. | Ostendens insuper etiam salubres manuductiones
quibus | minus dispositus abilitetur,' etc.
What we may call the business title of this book is
much more sensibly set forth in the brief colophon:
'Explicit exhortacio de celebratione misse per
modum dyalogi inter pontificem et sacerdotem,
Anno Lxx&#659;,' &amp;c. Still, here also, the absence of an
incipit, and of any following text must be taken
as constituting a title-page. Three years later two
Augsburg printers, Bernardus 'pictor' and Erhardus<!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Ratdolt, who had started a partnership in Venice
with Petrus Löslein of Langenzenn in Bavaria, produced
the first artistic title-page as yet discovered.
This appears in all the three editions of a Calendar
which they issued in Latin and Italian in 1476, and
in German in 1478. The praises of the Calendar are
sung in twelve lines of verse, beginning in the Latin
edition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aureus hic liber est: non est preciosior ulla<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Monstrantur facile: cunctaque signa poli.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then follows the date, then the names of the three
printers in red ink. This letterpress is surrounded
by a border in five pieces, the uppermost of which
shows a small blank shield (see p. 19), while on the
two sides skilfully conventionalised foliage is springing
out of two urns. The two gaps between these
and the printers' names are filled up by two small
blocks of tracery. It is noteworthy that this
charming design was employed by printers from
Augsburg, the city in which wood-engraving was
first seriously employed for the decoration of
printed books. But the design itself is distinctly
Italian in its spirit, not German.</p>

<p>Like its two predecessors, the title-page of 1476
was a mere anticipation, and was not imitated.
The systematic development of the title-page begins
in the early part of the next decade, when the custom<!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of printing the short title of the book on a first page,
otherwise left blank, came slowly into use.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
two earliest appearances of these label title-pages
in England are (1) in 'A passing gode lityll boke
necessarye &amp; behouefull agenst the Pestilens,' by
'Canutus, Bishop of Aarhus,' printed by Machlinia,
probably towards the close of his career [1486-90?];
and (2) in one of the earliest works printed by
Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's foreman, after his
master's death. Here, in the centre of the first
page, we find a three-line paragraph reading:</p>

<blockquote><p>The prouffytable boke for mañes soule And right comfortable
to the body and specially in aduersitee &amp;
tribulation, which boke is called The Chastysynge of
goddes Chyldern.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other countries were earlier than England both in
the adoption of the label title-page and in filling
the blank space beneath the title with some attempt
at ornament. In France the ornament usually
took the form of a printer's mark, more rarely of an
illustration; in Italy and Germany usually of an
illustration, more rarely of a printer's mark. Until
the first quarter of the sixteenth century was drawing
to a close the colophon still held its place at the
end of the book as the chief source of information
as to the printer's name and place and date of
publication. The author's name, also, was often<!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
reserved for the colophon, or hidden away in a
preface or dedicatory letter. Title-pages completed
according to the fashion which, until the antiquarian
revival by William Morris of the old label form, has
ever since held sway, do not become common till
about 1520.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief reason why the convenient
custom of the title-page spread so slowly was that
soon after 1470 the Augsburg printers began to imitate
in woodcuts the elaborate borders with which
the illuminators had been accustomed to decorate
the first page of the text of a manuscript or early
printed book. When they first appear these woodcut
borders grow out of the initial letter with which
the text begin, and extend only over part of the
upper and inner margins. In other instances,
however, they completely surround the first page
of text, and this is nearly always the case with the
very beautiful borders which are found, towards the
close of the century, in many books printed in Italy.
In these they are mostly preceded by a 'label'
title-page. The use of borders to surround every
page of text was practically confined<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to books of
devotion, notably the Books of Hours, whose wonderful
career began in 1487 and lasted for upwards
of half a century. Head-pieces are found in a few
books, chiefly Greek, printed at Venice towards the
close of the fifteenth century. In the absence of<!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
any previous investigations on the subject, it is
dangerous to attempt to say where tail-pieces first
occur, but their birthplace was probably France.</p>

<p>Pagination and head-lines are said to have been
first used by Arnold ther Hoernen at Cologne in
1470 and 1471; printed signatures by John Koelhoff
at the same city in 1472. The date of Koelhoff's
book, an edition of Nider's <i>Expositio Decalogi</i>, has
been needlessly held to be a misprint, though it is a
curious coincidence that we find signatures stamped
by hand in one edition of Franciscus de Platea's <i>De
restitutionibus</i>, Venice, 1473, and printed close to the
text in the normal way in another edition issued
at Cologne the following year. None of these small
matters have any direct bearing on the decoration of
books, but they are of interest to us as pointing to
the printer's gradual emancipation from his long
dependence on the help of the scribe. It is perhaps
worth while, for the same reason, to take as a landmark
Günther Zainer's 1473 edition of the <i>De regimine
principum</i> of Aegidius Columna. This book
is possessed of printed head-lines, chapter headings,
paragraph marks, and large and small initial letters.
From first page to last it is untouched by the hand
of the rubricator, and shows that Zainer at any
rate had won his independence within five years of
setting up his press. Curiously enough, to this
particular specimen of his work he did not give his
name, though it is duly dated.</p>

<h3>GERMANY&mdash;1470-1486</h3>


<p>In the fifteenth century Augsburg was one of the
chief centres in Germany for card-making and woodcut
pictures. The cutters were jealous of their
privileges, and when, in 1471, Günther Zainer, a
native of Reutlingen, who had been printing in their
town for some years (his first book was issued in
March 1468), asked for admission to the privileges
of a burgher, they not only opposed him, but demanded
that he should be forbidden to print
woodcuts in his books. The abbot of SS. Ulric
and Afra, Melchior de Stamheim, who subsequently
set up presses of his own, procured a compromise,
and Günther was allowed to employ woodcuts
freely, so long as they were cut by authorised
cutters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i_048.jpg"><img src="images/i_048_tn.jpg" width="400" height="298" alt="" title="linked to larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">From Ingold&#39;s <i>Guldin Spiel</i>, Augsburg, 1472.</span>
</div>

<p>Zainer's first dated book with illustrations is a
translation of the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> of Jacobus de
Voragine, with a small cut prefacing each of the two
hundred and thirty-four biographies. The first part
of this was finished in October 1471, and the second
in April 1472. In 1472 came also two editions of
the <i>Belial</i> or 'processus Luciferi contra Jesum
Christum,' in which thirty-two cuts help the under<!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>standing
of the extraordinary text, and to the same
year belongs Ingold's <i>Das guldin Spiel</i>, a wonderful
work, in which the seven deadly sins are illustrated
from seven games. As a copy of this book is available,
which has had the good fortune to escape the
colourist, one of its twelve cuts&mdash;that showing card-playing,
with which an Augsburg woodcutter would
be especially familiar&mdash;is here reproduced. The
face of the man at the far end of the table is perhaps
the most expressive piece of drawing in all the
series. In 1473 Zainer printed for the Abbot of
SS. Ulric and Afra a <i>Speculum Humanae Salvationis</i>,
with numerous Biblical woodcuts. He also
issued two editions in 1473 and 1477 of a Bible, with
large initial letters, into each of which is introduced
a little picture. At the end of the second of these
editions he adds the fine device, shown on p. 40,
which it is strange that he should not have
used more often. In 1474 he printed an account
of the supposed murder of a small boy, named
Simon, by the Jews, illustrated with some quite
vivid pictures, and to about this time belongs his
finest work, an undated edition of the <i>Speculum
Humanae Vitae</i>, full of numerous delightful cuts
illustrating various trades and callings. In 1477 he
illustrated a German edition of the moralisation of
the game of Chess by Jacobus de Cessolis, of which
Caxton had helped to print an English version a
year or two before.</p>

<span class="caption">Device of Günther Zainer.</span>
</div>

<p>During the ten or twelve years of his activity at<!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Augsburg, which was brought to a close by his death
in 1478, Günther Zainer printed probably at least
a hundred works, of which about twenty, mostly
either religious or, according to the ideas of the
time, amusing, have illustrations. Of the works
printed during the second half of his career, the
majority have woodcut initials, large or small, and
a few also woodcut borders to the first page. The
initials (which sometimes only extend through a
part of a book, blanks being left when the stock
failed), if seen by themselves, are rather clumsy,<!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
but harmonise well with the remarkably heavy
gothic type which Zainer chiefly used during this
period of his career. If his engraved work cannot
be praised as highly artistic, it was at least plentiful
and bold, and admirably adapted for the popular
books in which it mostly appeared.</p>

<p>Johann Bämler, who during twenty years from
1472 printed a long list of illustrated books at
Augsburg, can hardly have set much store by originality,
for in several of these, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Belial</i> (1473),
the <i>Plenarium</i> (1474), the <i>Legenda Sanctorum</i>, &amp;c.,
the cuts are wholly or mainly copied from those in
editions previously issued by Zainer.</p>

<p>Bämler began his own career as an illustrator with
some frontispieces, as we may call them, which come
after the table of contents, and facing the first page
of text in the <i>Summa Confessorum</i> of Johannes
Friburgensis, the <i>Goldenen Harfen</i> of Nider, and
others of his early books. In 1474 he issued the
first of his three editions of the <i>Buch von den Sieben
Todsünden und den Sieben Tugenden</i>. The 'Sins
and Virtues' are personified as armed women riding
on various animals, with various symbolical devices
on their shields, banners, and helmets. But the
ladies' faces are all very much alike, and the armorial
symbolism is so recondite, that a considerable
acquaintance with medieval 'Bestiaries' would be
required to decipher it. Far better than this conventional
work are the cuts in the <i>Buch der Natur</i>,
printed by Bämler in the next year. This is a<!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
fourteenth-century treatise dealing with men and
women, with the sky and its signs, with beasts,
trees, vegetables, stones, and famous wells, and, as
in Zainer's <i>Spiegel des menschlichen Lebens</i>, the artist
drew from nature far better than from his imagination.
In an edition of Königshofen's <i>Chronik von
allen Königen und Kaisern</i>, printed in 1476, Bämler
inserted four full-page cuts representing Christ in
glory, the Emperor Sigismund dreaming in his bed,
St. Veronica holding before her the cloth miraculously
imprinted with the face of Christ, and the
vision of Pope Gregory, when the crucified Christ
appeared to him on the altar.</p>

<p>Of Bämler's later books, his edition (issued in
1482), of the History of the Crusades (<i>Türken-Kreuzzüge</i>),
by Rupertus de Sancto Remigio, is
perhaps the most noticeable. The large cut of the
Pope, attended by a young cardinal, preaching to a
crowd of pilgrims, whose exclamation of 'Deus
Vult' is represented by a scroll between them and
the preacher, is really a fine piece of work, though
the buildings in the background, from whose windows
listeners are thrusting their heads, have the
usual curious resemblance to bathing-machines.
Some of the smaller cuts also are good, notably one
of a group of mounted pilgrims, which has a real
out-of-door effect. After 1482, though he lived
another twenty years, Bämler published few or no
new works, being content to reprint his old editions.</p>

<p>Our next Augsburg printer is Anton Sorg, whose<!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
first dated work with woodcuts is the <i>Buch der
Kindheit unseres Herrn</i> (1476). In his <i>Büchlein
das da heisset der Seelen Trost</i>, he produced the first
series of illustrations to the Ten Commandments,&mdash;large
full-page cuts, rudely executed. His <i>Passion
nach dem Texte der vier Evangelisten</i>, first issued in
1480, ran through no less than five editions in twelve
years. In 1481 he produced the first German
translation of the <i>Travels of Mandeville</i>, illustrated
with numerous cuts of some merit. By far his most
famous work is his edition of Reichenthal's account
of the Council of Constance, illustrated with more
than eleven hundred cuts, chiefly of the arms of the
dignitaries there present. The arms were necessarily
intended to be coloured (the present system of
representing the heraldic colours by conventional
arrangements of lines and dots only dates from the
seventeenth century), and this fate has also befallen
the larger illustrations, whose workmanship is, indeed,
so rude, that it could scarcely stand alone.
These larger cuts represent processions of the Pope
and his cardinals, the dubbing of a knight, a tournament,
the burning of Huss for heresy, the scattering
of his ashes (which half fill a cart) over the fields,
and other incidents of the famous council. But the
interest of the book remains chiefly heraldic.</p>

<p>After 1480, printers of illustrated books became
numerous at Augsburg, Peter Berger, Johann
Schobsser, Hans Schauer, and Lucas Zeissenmaier
being rather more important than their fellows.<!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
More prolific than these, but not more enterprising
in respect to new designs, was the elder Hans
Schoensperger, who began his long career in 1481.
His chief claim to distinction is his printing of the
Emperor Maximilian's <i>Theuerdank</i>, to which we
shall refer in the next chapter. Erhard Ratdolt
deserves mention for his ten years' stay at Venice,
where, as we have seen, he issued in 1476 the <i>Calendar</i>,
which is the first book with an ornamental
title-page. In 1486 he returned to Augsburg at the
invitation of Bishop Friedrich von Hohenzollern to
print service-books, into which in future he put all
his best work. His types and initial letters he
brought with him from Italy; for his illustrations,
he had recourse to German artists of no exceptional
ability. A few of his service-books, however, are
distinguished by some interesting, if not very successful,
experiments in printing some of the colours
in his woodcuts.</p>

<p>The foregoing sketch of the chief illustrated books
published at Augsburg during the fifteenth century
can hardly escape the charge of dullness. It has
been worth while, however, to plod through with
it, because it may serve very well as an epitome
of the average illustrated work done between 1470
and 1490 throughout Germany. Some of the works
we have mentioned remained to the end Augsburg
books&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> the <i>Buch der Kunst geistlich zu werden</i>,
the <i>Buch der Natur</i>, the <i>Historie aus den Geschichten
der Römer</i>, were repeatedly published there and<!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
nowhere else. Others, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Historie des Königs
Apollonius</i>, were shared between Augsburg and
Ulm, chiefly, no doubt, through the relationship of
the two Zainers. The <i>Historia Trojana</i> of Guido
delle Colonne and the <i>Geschichte des grossen Alexander</i>
enjoyed long careers at Augsburg, and were
then taken up by Martin Schott at Strasburg.
Eleven editions of the <i>Belial</i> of Jacobus de Theramo
were shared fairly equally between the two cities.
The Bible and the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> were of too widespread
an interest to be monopolised by one or two
places. A few books, like the <i>Æsop</i> and the <i>De
Claris Mulieribus</i> of Boccaccio, which start from
Ulm, or the early <i>Fasciculus Temporum</i>, of which
more than half the early editions belonged to
Cologne, trace their source elsewhere than to Augsburg.
But it was at Augsburg that the majority
of the popular illustrated books of the fifteenth
century were first published, and the editions issued
in other towns were mostly more or less servile
imitations of them.</p>

<p>Next in importance to Augsburg in the early
history of illustrated books in Germany, ranks the
neighbouring city of Ulm, where the names of wood-engravers
are found in the town registers from the
early part of the century, and the printers had thus
plenty of good material to call to their aid. The
first illustrated book which we know with certainty
to have been printed at Ulm is the <i>De Claris Mulieribus</i>
of Boccaccio, issued by Johann Zainer, in a<!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Latin edition dated 1473, and in a German translation,
with the same cuts, about the same time.
This Johann Zainer was probably a kinsman of
Günther Zainer of Augsburg, but very little is known
of him. The <i>De Claris Mulieribus</i> begins with
a fine engraved border extending over the upper
and inner margins of the first page. It is not merely
decorative but pictorial, the subject represented
being the Temptation of Adam and Eve. Eve is
handing her husband an apple from the Forbidden
Tree, amid whose branches is seen the head of the
serpent, his body being twisted into a large initial S,
and then tapering away into the upper section of
the border, where it becomes a branch, among the
leaves of which appear emblems of the seven deadly
sins. The numerous woodcuts in the text are
quite equal to the average Augsburg work. Our
illustration shows Scipio warning Massinissa to put
away his newly married wife, and the hapless
Sophonisba drinking the poison, which is the
only marriage gift her husband could send her.</p>

<span class="caption">From Boccaccio <i>De Clar. Mul.</i>, Ulm, 1473.</span>
</div>

<p>Zainer's most striking success was achieved by
his edition of Steinhöwel's version of the <i>Life and
Fables of Æsop</i>, of which no less than eleven editions
were printed in various German towns before the
end of the century, for the most part closely copied
from the Ulm original. In this, there are altogether
two hundred woodcuts, eleven of which
belong to the story of Sigismund at the end of the
book. The frontispiece is a large picture of Æsop,<!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
who, here and throughout the chapters devoted to
his imaginary 'life,' is represented as a knavish
clown, a variant of Eulenspiegel or Marcolphus.
Some of the illustrations to the fables are very good,
notably those of the Sower and the Birds, the Huntsman,
and King Stork, here reproduced from Sorg's
reprint. The <i>Æsop</i> and the Boccaccio <i>De Claris
Mulieribus</i> give Johann Zainer a high place among
the German printers of illustrated books. His
other work was unimportant and mostly imitative.
His types are much smaller than those used in the
early Augsburg books, and his initials less heavy
and massive. They are not more than an inch
high, and consist of a simple outline overlaid with
jagged work.</p>

<p>In 1482, Leonhard Holl printed at Ulm an edition
of Ptolemy's <i>Cosmographia</i>, which contains the first
woodcut map and fine initial letters, one of which,

his book to the Pope, is given as a <a href="#Frontispiece_Chapter3">frontispiece to
this chapter</a>. In 1483 he issued the first of many
editions of the <i>Buch der Weisheit der alten Menschen
von Anbeginn der Welt</i>. The wisdom of the ancients
chiefly takes the form of fables, which are illustrated
with cuts, larger but much less artistic than
those of Zainer's <i>Æsop</i>. From Conrad Dinkmuth we
have the first illustrated editions of three notable
works, the <i>Seelenwurzgarten</i>, or 'Garden of the Soul'
(1483), Thomas Lirar's <i>Schwäbische Chronik</i> (1486),
and the <i>Eunuchus</i> of Terence (1486). This last is<!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
illustrated with fourteen remarkable woodcuts,
over five inches by seven in size, and each occupying
about three-fourths of a page. The scene is
mostly laid in a street, and there is some attempt
at perspective in the vista of houses. The figures
of the characters are fairly good, but not above the
average Ulm work of the time. Two later Ulm
books, written by Gulielmus Caoursin and printed
by Johann Reger in 1496, are of great interest, one
giving the <i>Stabilimenta</i> or ordinances, of the Order
of St. John of Jerusalem, the other an account of
the successful defence of Rhodes by its knights
against the Turks. Both are richly illustrated with
woodcuts of very considerable artistic merit.</p>

<p>At Lübeck in 1475 Lucas Brandis printed, as his
first book, a notable edition of the <i>Rudimentum
Noviciorum</i>, an epitome of history, sacred and profane,
during the six ages of the world. The epitome
is epitomised at the beginning of the book by ten
pages of cuts, mostly of circles linked together by
chains, and bearing the name of some historical
character. Into the space left by these circles are
introduced pictures of the world's history from the
Creation and the Flood down to the life of Christ,
which is told in a series of nine cuts on the last page.
The first page of the text is surrounded, except at
the top, by a border in three pieces, into one section
of which are introduced birds, and into another a
blank shield supported by two lions. The inner
margin of the first page of text bears a fine figure of a<!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
man reading a scroll, and the two columns are
separated by a spiral of leaves climbing round a
stick. The cuts in the text are partly repeated
from the preliminary pages, partly new, though
extreme economy is shown in their use, one figure
of a philosopher standing for at least twenty different
sages. The large initial letters at the beginning
of the various books have scenes introduced into
them, the little battle-piece in the Q of the 'Quinta
aetas' being the most remarkable. Altogether
this is a very splendid and noteworthy book, and
one which Brandis never equalled in his later work.</p>

<p>At Nuremberg in 1472, Johann Sensenschmidt,
its first printer, issued a German Bible, introducing
illustrations into the large initial letters. At
Cologne first one printer and then another published
illustrated editions (ten in all) of the <i>Fasciculus
Temporum</i>, though the cuts in these are mostly
restricted to a few conventional scenes of cities,
and representations of the Nativity and Crucifixion
and of Christ in glory. At Cologne also,
about 1480, there appeared two great German dialect
Bibles in two volumes, in the type and with borders
which are found in books signed by Heinrich
Quentel, to whose press they are therefore assigned.
There are altogether one hundred and twenty-five
cuts, ninety-four in the Old Testament (thirty-three
of which illustrate the life of Moses), and thirty-one
in the New. They are of considerable size, stretching
right across the double-columned page, and are<!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the work of a skilful, but not very highly inspired,
artist. They have neither the naïveté of the early
Augsburg and Ulm workmen, nor the richness of
the later German work. They were, however,
immensely popular at the time. In 1483 Anton
Koberger copied them at Nuremberg, omitting, however,
the borders which occur on the first and third
pages of the first volume, and at the beginning of
the New Testament, and rejecting also nineteen of
the thirty-one New Testament illustrations. The
cuts were used again in other editions, and influenced
later engravers for many years. Hans
Holbein even used them as the groundwork for his
own designs for the Old Testament printed by
Adam Petri at Basel in 1523.</p>

<p>At Strassburg, illustrated books were first issued
by Knoblochtzer in 1477, and after 1480, Martin
Schott and Johann Prüss printed them in considerable
numbers. Both these printers, however, were
as a rule contented to reproduce the woodcuts in
the different Augsburg books, and the original
works issued by them are mostly poor. An exception
may be made in favour of the undated <i>Buch der
Heiligen drei Könige</i> of Johannes Hildeshemensis,
printed by Prüss. This has a good border round the
upper and inner margins of the first page of text woodcut
initials, and fifty-eight cuts of considerable merit.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>At Mainz, Peter Schoeffer was very slow in introducing
pictures into his books, making no use of
them until he took to Missal printing in 1483, when
a cut of the Crucifixion became almost obligatory.
In 1479, however, a remarkable reprint of the
<i>Meditationes</i> of Cardinal Turrecremata had been
issued at Mainz by Johann Numeister or Neumeister,
a wandering Mainz printer, who had previously
worked at Foligno, and is subsequently found at
Albi, but now while revisiting his native place published
there reduced adaptations of the cuts in the
editions printed by Hahn at Rome (see Chapter V),
worked on soft metal instead of on wood.</p>

<p>In addition to the places we have mentioned,
illustrated books were issued during this period by
Bernhard Richel at Basel, by Conrad Fyner at
Esslingen, and by other printers in less important
German towns. But those we have already discussed
are perhaps sufficient as representatives of
the first stage of book-illustration in Germany.
They have all this much in common that they are
planned and carried out under the immediate direction
of the printers themselves, each of whom seems
to have had one or more wood-engravers attached
to his office, who drew their own designs upon the
wood and cut them themselves. There is a maximum
of outline-work, a minimum of shading and<!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
no cross-hatching. Every line is as direct and simple
as possible. At times the effect is inconceivably
rude, at times it is delightful in its child-like originality,
and the craftsman's efforts to give expression
to the faces are sometimes almost ludicrously successful.
To the present writer these simple woodcuts
are far more pleasing than all the glories of
the illustrated work of the next century. They are
in keeping with the books they decorate, in keeping
with the massive black types and the stiff white
paper. After 1500, we may almost say after 1490,
we shall find that the printing and illustrating of
books are no longer closely allied trades. An artist
draws a design with pen and ink, a clever mechanic
imitates it as minutely as he can on the wood, and
the design is then carelessly printed in the midst of
type-work, which bears little relation to it. Paper
and ink also are worse, and types smaller and less
carefully handled. Everything was sacrificed to
cheapness, and the result was as dull as cheap work
usually is. By the time that the great artists began
to turn their attention to book-illustration, printing
in Germany was almost a lost art.<!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Many of Knoblochtzer's books also have very pretentious borders,
though the designs are usually coarse. A quarto border used in his
<i>Salomon et Marcolfus</i> with a large initial letter, and a folio one in his
reprint of <i>Æsop</i> perhaps show his best work. These are reproduced,
with many other examples of his types, initials, and illustrations in
<i>Heinrich Knoblochtzer in Strassburg von Karl Schorbach und Max
Spirgatis</i>. (Strassburg, 1888.)<!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>GERMANY, FROM 1486</h3>


<p>The second period of book-illustration in Germany
dates from the publication at Mainz in 1486 of
Bernhard von Breydenbach's celebrated account of
his pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Two years previously
Schoeffer had brought out a <i>Herbarius</i> in which one
hundred and fifty plants were illustrated, mostly
only in outline, and in 1485 he followed this up with
another work of the same character, the <i>Gart der
Gesundheyt</i>, which has between three and four hundred
cuts of plants and animals, and a fine frontispiece
of botanists in council. This in its turn formed
the basis of Jacob Meidenbach's enlarged Latin
edition of the same work, published under the title
of <i>Hortus Sanitatis</i>, with additional cuts and full-page
frontispieces to each part. These three books
in the naïveté and simplicity of some of their illustrations,
belong to the period which we have reviewed
in our last chapter, but in other cuts a real
effort seems to have been made to reproduce the
true appearance of the plant, and the increased care
for accuracy links them with the newer work.
It is, however, the <i>Opus transmarinae peregrinationis
ad sepulchrum dominicum in Jherusalem</i><!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
which opens a new era, as the first work executed
by an artist of distinction as opposed to the nameless
craftsmen at whose woodcuts we have so far been
looking.</p>

<p>When Bernhard von Breydenbach went on his
pilgrimage in 1483 he took with him the artist,
Erhard Reuwich, and while Breydenbach made
notes of their adventures, Reuwich sketched the
inhabitants of Palestine, and drew wonderful maps
of the places they visited. On their return to
Mainz in 1484, Breydenbach began writing out his
Latin account of the pilgrimage, and Reuwich not
only completed his drawings, but took so active a
part in passing the work through the press that,
though the types used in it apparently belonged to
Schoeffer, he is spoken of as its printer. The book
appeared in 1486, and as its magnificence deserved,
was issued on vellum as well as on paper. Its first
page was blank, the second is occupied by a frontispiece,
in which the art of wood-engraving attained
at a leap to an unexampled excellence. In the
centre of the composition is the figure of a woman,
personifying the town of Mainz, standing on a
pedestal, below and on either side of which are the
shields of Breydenbach and his two noble companions,
the Count of Solms and Sir Philip de Bicken. The
upper part of the design is occupied by foliage amid
which little naked boys are happily scrambling.
The dedication to the Archbishop of Mainz begins
with a beautiful, but by no means legible, R, in<!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
which a coat of arms is enclosed in light and graceful
branches. This, and the smaller S which begins
the preface are the only two printed initials in the
volume. All the rest are supplied by hand.</p>

<a href="images/i_068.jpg"><img src="images/i_068_tn.jpg" width="400" height="274" alt="" title="linked to larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">Saracens from Breydenbach.</span>
</div>

<p>The most noticeable feature in the book are seven
large maps, of Venice, Parenzo in Illyria, Corfu,
Modon, near the bay of Navarino, Crete, Rhodes,
and Jerusalem. These are of varying sizes, from
that of Venice, which is some five feet in length,
to those of Parenzo and Corfu, which only cover
a double-page. They are panoramas rather than
maps, and are plainly drawn from painstaking
sketches, with some attempt at local colour in the
people on the quays and the shipping. Besides
these maps there is a careful drawing, some six
inches square, of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
headed 'Haec est dispositio et figura templi dominici
sepulchri ab extra,' and cuts of Saracens (here shown),
two Jews, Greeks, both seculars and monks, Syrians
and Indians, with tables of the alphabets of their
respective languages. Spaces are also left for
drawings of Jacobites, Nestorians, Armenians, and
Georgians, which apparently were not engraved.</p>

<p>After Breydenbach and his fellows had visited
Jerusalem they crossed the desert to the shrine of
St. Katharine on Mount Sinai, and this part of their
travels is illustrated by a cut of a cavalcade of Turks
in time of peace. There is also a page devoted to
drawings of animals, showing a giraffe, a crocodile,
two Indian goats, a camel led by a baboon with a<!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
long tail and walking stick, a salamander and a
unicorn. Underneath the baboon is written 'non
constat de nomine' ('name unknown'), and the
presence of the unicorn did not prevent the travellers
from solemnly asserting,&mdash;'Haec animalia sunt veraciter
depicta sicut vidimus in terra sancta!' At
the end of the text is Reuwich's device, a woman
holding a shield, on which is depicted the figure of
a bird. The book is beautifully printed, in a small
and very graceful gothic letter. It obtained the
success it deserved, for there was a speedy demand
for a German translation (issued in 1488), and at
least six different editions were printed in Germany
during the next twenty years, besides other translations.</p>

<p>Alike in its inception and execution Breydenbach's
<i>Pilgrimage</i> stands on a little pinnacle by itself, and
the next important books which we have to notice,
Stephan's <i>Schatzbehalter oder Schrein der wahren
Reichthümer des Heils und ewiger Seligkeit</i> and
Hartmann Schedel's <i>Liber Chronicarum</i>, usually
known as the <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>, are in every
respect inferior, even the unsurpassed profusion of
the woodcuts in the latter being almost a sin against
good taste. Both works were printed by Anton
Koberger of Nuremberg, the one in 1491, the other
two years later, and in both the illustrations were
designed, partly or entirely, by Michael Wohlgemuth,
whose initial W appears on many of the cuts
in the <i>Schatzbehalter</i>. Of these there are nearly a<!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hundred, each of which occupies a large folio page,
and measures nearly seven inches by ten. The
composition in many of these pictures is good, and
the fine work in the faces and hair show that we
have travelled very far away from the outline cuts
of the last chapter. On the other hand, there is no
lack of simplicity in some of the scenes from the
Old Testament. In his anxiety, for instance, to
do justice to Samson's exploits, the artist has represented
him flourishing the jawbone of the ass over
a crowd of slain Philistines, while with the gates of
Gaza on his back he is casually choking a lion with
his foot. In the next cut he is walking away with a
pillar, while the palace of the Philistines, apparently
built without any ground floor, is seen toppling in
the air. In contrast with these primitive conceptions
we find the figure of Christ often invested with
real dignity, and the representation of God the
Father less unworthy than usual. In the only
copy of the book accessible to me the cuts are all
coloured, so that it is impossible to give a specimen
of them, but the figure of Noah reproduced from
the <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i> gives a very fair idea of
the work of Wohlgemuth, or his school, at its best.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 172px;">
<a href="images/i_072.jpg"><img src="images/i_072_tn.jpg" width="172" height="400" alt="" title="linked to larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">From the <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The <i>Chronicle</i>, to which we must now turn, is a
mighty volume of rather over three hundred leaves,
with sixty-five or sixty-six lines to each of its great
pages. It begins with the semblance of a title-page
in the inscription in large woodcut letters on its first
page, 'Registrum huius operis libri cronicarum cum<!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
figuris et ymaginibus ab inicio mundi,' though this
really amounts only to a head-line to the long table
of contents which follows. It is noticeable, also, as
showing how slowly printed initials were adopted in
many towns in Germany, that a blank is left at the
beginning of each alphabetical section of this table,
and a larger blank at the beginning of the prologue,
and that throughout the volume there are no large
initial letters. This is also the case with the <i>Schatzbehalter</i>,
the blanks in the British Museum copy
being filled up with garish illumination. After the
'table' in the <i>Chronicle</i> there is a frontispiece of
God in Glory, at the foot of which are two blank
shields held by wild men. The progress of the work
of creation is shown by a series of circles, at first
blank, afterwards more and more filled in. In the
first five the hand of God appears in the upper left-hand
corner, to signify His creative agency. The
two chief features in the <i>Chronicle</i> itself are its
portraits and its maps. The former are, of course,
entirely imaginary, and the invention of the artist
was not equal to devising a fresh head for every
person mentioned in the text, a pardonable economy
considering that there are sometimes more than
twenty of these heads scattered over a single page
and connected together by the branches of a quasi-genealogical
tree. The maps, if not so good as those
in Breydenbach's <i>Pilgrimage</i>, are still good. For
Ninive, for 'Athene vel Minerva,' for Troy, and
other ancient places, the requisite imagination was<!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
forthcoming; while the maps of Venice,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of Florence,
and of other cities of Italy, France, and Germany,
appear to give a fair idea of the chief features of the
places represented. Nuremberg, of course, has the
distinction of two whole pages to itself (the other
maps usually stretch across only the lower half of
the book), and full justice is done to its churches of
S. Lawrence and S. Sebaldus, to the Calvary outside
the city walls, and to the hedge of spikes, by which
the drawbridge was protected from assault.</p>

<p>We shall have very soon to return again to Wohlgemuth
and Nuremberg, but in the year which
followed the production of the great <i>Chronicle</i>
Sebastian Brant's <i>Narrenschiff</i> attracted the eyes
of the literary world throughout Europe to the
city of Basel, and we also may be permitted to
digress thither. In the year of the <i>Chronicle</i> itself
a Basel printer, Michael Furter, had produced a
richly illustrated work, the <i>Ritter vom Thurn von
den Exempeln der Gottesfurcht und Ehrbarkeit</i>, the
cuts in which have ornamental borders on each side
of them. Brant had recourse to Furter a little later,
but for his <i>Narrenschiff</i> he went to Bergmann de
Olpe, from whose press it was published in 1494.
The engraver or engravers (for there seem to have<!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
been at least two different hands at work) of its one
hundred and fourteen cuts are not known, but
Brant is said to have closely supervised the work,
and may possibly have furnished sketches for it
himself. Many of the illustrations could hardly
be better. The satire on the book-fool in his library
is too well known to need description; other excellent
cuts are those of the children gambling and
fighting while the fool-father sits blindfold,&mdash;of
the fool who tries to serve two masters, depicted as
a hunter setting his dog to run down two hares in
different directions,&mdash;of the fool who looks out of
the window while his house is on fire,&mdash;of the sick
fool (<a href="#The_Sick_Fool">here shown</a>) who kicks off the bedclothes and
breaks the medicine bottles while the doctor vainly
tries to feel his pulse,&mdash;of the fool who allows
earthly concerns to weigh down heavenly ones (a
miniature city and a handful of stars are the contents
of the scales),&mdash;of the frightened fool who has
put to sea in a storm, and many others. The popularity
of the book was instantaneous and immense.
Imitations of the Basel edition were printed and
circulated all over Germany: in 1497 Bergmann
published a Latin version by Jacob Locher with
the same cuts, and translations speedily appeared
in almost every country in Europe. It is noteworthy
that in the <i>Narrenschiff</i> we have no longer
to deal with a great folio but with a handy quarto,
and that, save for its cuts and the adjacent brokers,
it has no artistic pretensions.<!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">The Sick Fool</span>
</div>

<p>In the same year (1494) as the <i>Narrenschiff</i>,
Bergmann printed another of Brant's works, his
poems 'In laudem Virginis Mariae' and of the
Saints, with fourteen cuts, and in 1495 his <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><i>De
origine et conservatione bonorum regum et laude
civitatis Hierosolymae</i>, which has only two, but
these of considerable size. In the following year
Brant transferred his patronage to Michael Furter,
who printed his <i>Passio Sancti Meynhardi</i>, with
fifteen large cuts, by no means equal to those of
the <i>Narrenschiff</i>. In 1498 the indefatigable author
employed both his printers, giving to Bergmann his
<i>Varia Carmina</i> and to Furter his edition of the
<i>Revelatio S. Methodii</i>, which is remarkable not only
for its fifty-five illustrations, but for Brant's allusion
to his own theory, 'imperitis pro lectione pictura
est,' to the unlearned a picture is the best text.
After 1498 Brant removed to Strassburg, where
his influence was speedily apparent in the illustrated
books published by Johann Grüninger, who in 1494
had issued as his first illustrated book an edition
of the <i>Narrenschiff</i>, and in 1496 published an illustrated
and annotated <i>Terence</i>. He followed these
up with other editions of the <i>Narrenschiff</i>, Brant's
<i>Carmina Varia</i>, and a <i>Horace</i> (1498), with over six
hundred cuts, many of which, however, had appeared
in the printer's earlier books. In 1501 he
produced an illustrated <i>Boethius</i>, and in the next
year two notable works, Brant's <i>Heiligenleben</i> and
an annotated <i>Virgil</i>, each of them illustrated with
over two hundred cuts, of which very few had been
used before.</p>

<p>The year 1494 was notable for the publication
not only of the <i>Narrenschiff</i>, but of a Low Saxon
Bible printed by Stephan Arndes at Lübeck, where<!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
he had been at work since 1488. The cuts to this
book show some advance upon those in previous
German Bibles, but they are not strikingly better
than the work in the <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>, to whose
designers we must now return. In 1496 we find
Wohlgemuth designing a frontispiece to an <i>Ode on
S. Sebaldus</i>, published by Conrad Celtes, a Nuremberg
scholar, with whom he had previously entered
into negotiations for illustrating an edition of <i>Ovid</i>,
which was never issued. In 1501 Celtes published
the comedies of Hroswitha, a learned nun of the
tenth century, who had undertaken to show what
charming religious plays might be written on the
lines of Terence. By far the finest of the large cuts
with which the book is illustrated is the second
frontispiece, in which Hroswitha, comedies in hand,
is being presented by her Abbess to the Emperor.
The designs to the plays themselves are dull enough,
a fault which those who are best acquainted with the
good nun's style as a dramatist will readily excuse.
Her one brilliant success, a scene in which a wicked
governor, who has converted his kitchen into a
temporary prison, is made to inflict his embraces
on the pots and pans, instead of on the holy maidens
immured amidst them, was not selected for illustration.</p>

<p>The woodcuts to the plays of Hroswitha were
designed by Wohlgemuth or his scholars, and this
was also the case with those in the <i>Quatuor libri
amorum</i>, published by Celtes in 1502, to which<!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Albrecht Dürer himself contributed three illustrations.
For three years, from St. Andrew's Day
1486, Dürer had served an apprenticeship to Wohlgemuth,
and when he returned to Nuremberg after
his 'Wanderjahre,' during which he seems to have
executed a single woodcut of no great merit for an
edition of the <i>Epistles of S. Jerome</i>, printed by
Nic. Kesler, at Basel, in 1492, he too began to work
as an illustrator. His first important effort in this
character is the series of sixteen wood-engravings,
illustrating the Apocalypse, printed at Nuremberg
in 1498. The first leaf bears a woodcut title <i>Die
heimliche Offenbarung Johannis</i>, and on the verso
of the last cut but one is the colophon, 'Gedrücket
zu Nurnbergk durch Albrecht Dürer maler, nach
Christi geburt <span class="smcap">M.CCCC</span> und darnach im xcviij iar.' It
has also in one or more editions some explanatory
text, taken from the Bible, but in spite of these
additions it is a portfolio of engravings rather than
a book, and as such does not come within our province.
On the same principle we can only mention,
without detailed description, the <i>Epitome in Divae
Parthenices Mariae historiam</i> of 1511, the <i>Passio
Domini nostri Jesu</i>, issued about the same date,
and the <i>Passio Christi</i>, or 'Little Passion,' as it is
usually called, printed about 1512. All these have
descriptive verses by the Benedictine monk Chelidonius
(though these do not appear in all copies),
but they belong to the history of wood-engraving
as such, and not to our humbler subject of book-<!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>illustration.
Still less need we concern ourselves
with the 'Triumphal Car' and 'Triumphal Arch'
of the Emperor Maximilian, designed by Dürer,
and published, the one in 1522, the other not till
after the artist's death. Besides these works and
the single sheet of the Rhinoceros of 1513, Dürer
designed frontispieces for an edition of his own poems
in 1510, for a life of S. Jerome by his friend Lazarus
Spengler in 1514, and for the <i>Reformation der Stadt
Nürnberg</i> of 1521. In 1513 also he drew a set of
designs for half-ornamental, half-illustrative borders
to fill in the blank spaces left in the Book of Prayers
printed on vellum for the Emperor Maximilian in
1514. By him also was the woodcut of Christ on
the Cross, which appears first in the Eichstätt
<i>Missal</i> of three years later. For us, however,
Dürer's importance does not lie in these particular
designs, but in the fact that he set an example of
drawing for the wood-cutters, which other artists
were not slow to follow.</p>

<p>In directing the attention of German artists to
the illustration of books, the Emperor Maximilian
played a more important part than Dürer himself.
As in politics, so in art, his designs were on too
ambitious a scale, and of the three great books he
projected, the <i>Theuerdank</i>, the <i>Weisskunig</i>, and the
<i>Freydal</i>, only the first was brought to a successful
issue. This is a long epic poem allegorising the
Emperor's wedding trip to Burgundy, and though
attributed to Melchior Pfintzing was apparently, to<!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a large extent, composed by Maximilian himself.
The printing was entrusted to the elder Hans Schoensperger
of Augsburg, but for some unknown reason,
when the book was completed in 1517, the honour
of its publication was allowed to Nuremberg. A
special fount of type was cut for it by Jost Dienecker
of Antwerp, who indulged in such enormous
flourishes, chiefly to any <i>g</i> or <i>h</i> which happened to
occur in the last line of text in a page, that many
eminent printers have imagined that the whole
book was engraved on wood. The difficulties of
the setting up, however, have been greatly exaggerated,
for the flourishes came chiefly at the top
or foot of the page, and are often not connected
with any letter in the text. In the present writer's
opinion it is an open question whether the type,
which is otherwise a very handsome one, is in any
way improved by these useless appendages. They
add on an average about an inch at the top and an
inch and a half at the foot to the column of the
text, which is itself ten inches in height, and contains
twenty-four lines to a full page. The task of
illustrating this royal work was entrusted to Hans
Schäufelein, an artist already in the Emperor's
employment, and from his designs there were engraved
one hundred and eighteen large cuts, each
of them six and a half inches high by five and a half
broad. The cuts, which chiefly illustrate hunting
scenes and knightly conflicts, are not conspicuously
better than those produced about the same time<!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
by other German artists, but they have the great
advantage of having been carefully printed on fine
vellum, and this has materially assisted their
reputation.</p>

<p>The <i>Weisskunig</i>, a celebration of Maximilian's life
and travels, and the <i>Freydal</i>, in honour of his
knightly deeds, were part of the same scheme as the
<i>Theuerdank</i>. The two hundred and thirty-seven
designs for the <i>Weisskunig</i> were mainly the work
of Hans Burgkmair,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> an Augsburg artist of repute;
its literary execution was entrusted to the Emperor's
secretary, Max Treitzsaurwein, who completed
the greater part of the text as early as 1512.
But the Emperor's death in 1519 found the great
work still unfinished, and it was not until 1775 that
it was published as a fragment, with the original
illustrations (larger, and perhaps finer, than those
in the <i>Theuerdank</i>), of which the blocks had, fortunately,
been preserved. The <i>Freydal</i>, though begun
as early as 1502, was left still less complete; the
designs for it, however, are in existence at Vienna.
The 'Triumph of the Emperor Maximilian,' another
ambitious work, with one hundred and thirty-five
woodcuts designed by Burgkmair, was first published
in 1796.</p>

<p>The death of Maximilian in 1519 and the less<!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
artistic tastes of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> caused German
illustrators to turn for work to the Augsburg
printers, and during the next few years we find them
illustrating a number of books for the younger
Schoensperger, for Hans Othmar, for Miller, and
for Grimm and Wirsung, all Augsburg firms. The
most important result of this activity was the
German edition of Petrarch's <i>De Remediis utriusque
Fortunae</i>, for which in the years immediately following
the Emperor's death an artist named Hans
Weiditz, whose identity has only lately been re-established,
drew no less than two hundred and
fifty-nine designs. Owing to the death of the
printer, Grimm, the book was put on one side,
but was finally brought out by Heinrich Steiner,
Grimm's successor, in 1532. In the interim some
of the cuts had been used for an edition of Cicero
<i>De Senectute</i>, and they were afterwards used again in
a variety of works. Despite the excellence of the
cuts the <i>Petrarch</i> is a very disappointing book. To
do justice to the fine designs the most delicate press
work was necessary, and, except when the pressmen
were employed by an Emperor, the delicacy
was not forthcoming; it may be said, indeed, that
it was made impossible by the poorness and softness
of the paper on which the book is printed. At this
period it was only the skill of individual artists
which prevented German books from being as dull
and uninteresting as they soon afterwards became.</p>

<p>Books of devotion in Germany never attained to<!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the beauty of the French <i>Horae</i>, but they did not
remain uninfluenced by them. In or before 1496 we
find a <i>Nouum B. Mariae Virginis Psalterium</i> printed
at Zinna, near Magdeburg, with very beautiful,
though florid, borders. In 1513 there appeared at
Augsburg a German prayer-book, entitled <i>Via Felicitatis</i>,
with thirty cuts, all with rich conventional
borders, probably by Hans Schäufelein, and we have
already seen that in the same year Dürer himself
designed borders for the Emperor's own <i>Gebetbuch</i>.
In 1515, again, Burgkmair had contributed a series
of designs, many of which had rich architectural
borders, to a <i>Leiden Christi</i>, published by Schoensperger
at Augsburg. In 1520 the same artist
designed another set of illustrations, with very
richly ornamented borders of flowers and animals,
for the <i>Devotissimae Meditationes de vita beneficiis
et passione Jesu Christi</i>, printed by Grimm. The
use of borders soon became a common feature in
German title-pages, especially in the small quartos
in which the Lutherans and anti-Lutherans carried
on their controversies; but it cannot be said that
they often exhibit much beauty.</p>

<p>The innumerable translations of the Bible, which
were another result of the Lutheran controversy,
also provided plenty of work for the illustrators.
The two Augsburg editions of the New Testament
in 1523 were both illustrated, the younger Schoensperger's
by Schäufelein, Silvan Othmar's by Burgkmair.
Burgkmair also issued a series of twenty-one<!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
illustrations to the Apocalypse, for which Othmar
had not had the patience to wait.</p>

<p>At Wittenberg the most important works issued
were the repeated editions of Luther's translation of<!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the Bible. Here also Lucas Cranach, who had previously
(in 1509) designed the cuts for what was
known as the <i>Wittenberger Heiligthumsbuch</i>, in 1521
produced his <i>Passional Christi und Antichristi</i>, in
which, page by page, the sufferings and humility of
Christ were contrasted with the luxury and arrogance
of the Pope. At Wittenberg, too, the thin
quartos with woodcut borders to their title-pages
were peculiarly in vogue, the majority of the designs
being poor enough, but some few having considerable
beauty, especially those of Lucas Cranach, of
which <a href="#Border_attributed_to_Lucas_Cranach">an example is here given</a>. Meanwhile, at
Strassburg, Hans Grüninger and Martin Flach and
his son continued to print numerous illustrated
works, largely from designs by Hans Baldung Grün,
and a still more famous publisher had arisen in the
person of Johann Knoblouch, who for some of his
books secured the help of Urs Graf, an artist whose
work preserved some of the old-fashioned simplicity
of treatment. At Nuremberg illustrated books
after Koburger's death proceeded chiefly from the
presses of Jobst Gutknecht and Peypus, for the latter
of whom Hans Springinklee, one of the minor artists
employed on the <i>Weisskunig</i>, occasionally drew
designs. At Basel Michael Furter continued to
issue illustrated books for the first fifteen years of
the new century, Johann Amorbach adorned with
woodcuts his editions of ecclesiastical statutes and
constitutions, and Adam Petri issued a whole series
of illustrated books, chiefly of religion and theology.<!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
To Basel Urs Graf gave the most and the best of his
work, and there the young Hans Holbein designed
in rapid succession the cuts for the New Testament
of 1522, for an <i>Apocalypse</i>, two editions of the
Pentateuch, and a Vulgate, besides numerous ornamental
borders. Some of these merely imitate the
rather tasteless designs of Urs Graf, in which the
ground plan is architectural, and relief is given by
a profusion of naked children, not always in very
graceful attitudes. Holbein's best designs are far
lighter and prettier. The foot of the border is
usually occupied by some historical scene, the death
of John the Baptist, Mucius Scævola and Porsenna,
the death of Cleopatra, the leap of Curtius, or
Hercules and Orpheus. In a title-page to the
<i>Tabula Cebetis</i> he shows the whole course of man's
life&mdash;little children crowding through the gate,
which is guarded by their 'genius,' and the fortune,
sorrow, luxury, penitence, virtue, and happiness
which awaits them. The two well-known
borders for the top and bottom of a page, illustrating
peasants chasing a thieving fox and their return
dancing, were designed for Andreas Cratander, for
whom also, as for Valentine Curio, Holbein drew
printers' devices. Ambrosius Holbein also illustrated
a few books, the most noteworthy in the eyes
of Englishmen being the 1518 edition of More's
<i>Utopia</i>, printed by Froben. His picture of Hercules
Gallicus, dragging along the captives of his eloquence,
part of a border designed for an <i>Aulus<!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Gellius</i> published by Cratander in 1519, is worthy
of Hans himself. While the German printers degenerated
ever more and more, those of Basel and
Zurich maintained a much higher standard of press-work,
and from 1540 to 1560, when the demand
for illustrated books had somewhat lessened, produced
a series of classical editions in tall folios,
well printed and on good paper, which at least
command respect. They abound with elaborate
initial letters, which are, however, too deliberately
pictorial to be in good taste. In Germany itself by
the middle of the sixteenth century the artistic
impulse had died away, or survived only in books
like those of Jost Amman, in which the text merely
explains the illustrations. It is a pleasure to go
back some seventy or eighty years and turn our
attention to the beginning of book-illustration in
Italy.</p>

<h3>ITALY&mdash;I
<br />
THE FIRST ILLUSTRATED BOOKS AND THOSE
OF VENICE</h3>


<p>Surrounded by pictures and frescoes, and accustomed
to the utmost beauty in their manuscripts,
the Italians did not feel the need of the cheaper
arts, and for the first quarter of a century after the
introduction of printing into their country, the use
of engraved borders, initial letters, and illustrations
was only occasional and sporadic. Perhaps not
very long after the middle of the century an Italian
block-book of the Passion had been issued, probably
at Venice, as it was there that most of the cuts
were used again in 1487 for an edition of the <i>Devote
Meditatione</i>, attributed to S. Bonaventura. A copy
of this is in the British Museum; of the block-book
eighteen leaves are preserved at Berlin. Despite
some ungainliness in the figures and rather coarse
cutting, the pictures are vigorous and effective,
but quite unlike any later Venetian work. Something
of the same kind may be said of those in an
edition of the <i>Meditationes</i> of Cardinal Turrecremata,
printed by Ulrich Hahn at Rome in 1467,<!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the first work printed in Italy with movable type,
in which woodcut illustrations were used. The
cuts are thirty-four in number, and professed to
illustrate the same subjects as the frescoes recently
painted by the cardinal's order in the Church of
San Maria di Minerva at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The execution is
so rude, that it is impossible to say whether they are
the work of a German influenced by Italian models,
or of an Italian working to please a German master,
nor is the point of the slightest importance. Thirty-three
of the cuts were used again in the editions
printed at Rome in 1473 and 1478, and it is from
the 1473 edition that the accompanying illustration
of the Flight into Egypt is taken. This in its
original size is one of the best of the series, but the
reduction necessary for its appearance on one of
our pages has had a more than usually unfortunate
effect, both on the cut itself and on the printer's
type which appears below it.</p>

<span class="caption">From the <i>Meditationes</i> of Turrecremata, Rome, 1473.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1481, the courtier-printer, Joannes Philippus
de Lignamine, issued an edition of the <i>Opuscula</i> of
Philippus de Barberiis adorned with twenty-nine
cuts representing twelve prophets, twelve sibyls,
St. John the Baptist, the Holy Family, Christ with
the Emblems of His Passion, the virgin Proba, and
the philosopher Plato. Plato, Malachi, and Hosea
are all represented by the same cut, another serves<!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
for both Jeremiah and Zechariah, and two of the
Sibyls are also made to merge their individualities.
With the exception of the figure of Christ, which is
merely painful, the cuts are pleasantly and even
ludicrously rude. Nevertheless, they are not without
vigour, and are, to my thinking, greatly preferable
to the more conventional figures of the<!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
twelve Sibyls and Proba which appeared shortly
afterwards in an undated edition of the same book,
printed by Sixtus Riessinger. In this edition the
figures are surrounded by architectural borders,
and we have also a border to the first page and
several large initial letters, all in exact imitation of
the interlacement work, which is the commonest
form of decoration in Italian manuscripts of the
time. Riessinger's mark, a girl holding a black
shield with a white arrow on it, and a scroll
with the letters S.R.D.A. (Sixtus Riessinger de Argentina),
is found in the 'register' at the end of the
book. To Riessinger we also owe a <i>Cheiromantia</i>,
with figures of hands, which I have not seen, while
from Lignamine's press there was issued an edition
of the <i>Herbarium</i> of Apuleius Barbarus (who was,
of course, confused with his famous namesake),
which has rude botanical figures and, at the end of
the book, a most man-like portrait of a mandrake,
with a dog duly tugging at one of his fibrous legs.
The list of illustrated books printed at Rome before
1490 also includes<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> some little editions, mostly by
Silber or Plannck, of the <i>Mirabilia Romae</i>, a guidebook
to the antiquities of the city, in which there
are a few cuts of pilgrims gazing at the cloth of
S. Veronica, of SS. Peter and Paul, of Romulus and<!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Remus, and other miscellaneous subjects. The
interest of all these books is purely antiquarian.</p>

<p>If we turn from Rome to the neighbouring city
of Naples, we shall find evidence of much more
artistic work. In 1478 Sixtus Riessinger printed
there for Francesco Tuppo an edition of Boccaccio's
<i>Libro di florio e di bianzefiore</i>, or <i>Philocolo</i>, illustrated
with forty-one woodcuts, of no great technical merit,
but by no means without charm. Two years later
a representation of the supposed origin of music by
the figures of five blacksmiths working at an anvil
occurs in an edition of the <i>Musices Theoria</i> of Francesco
Gafori, printed in 1480 by Francesco di Dino.
Much more important than this is a handsome
edition of <i>Æsop</i> published in 1485 by Francesco
Tuppo, and printed for him by an anonymous
firm known to bibliographers as the 'Germain
fidelissimi.' This contains eighty-seven large cuts
heavily cut, but well drawn and with a massive
vigour, one of which, representing the death of
Æsop, occupies a full page. The cuts illustrating
the fabulist's life have rather commonplace borders
to them, but when the fables themselves are reached,
these are replaced by much more important ones.
Into an upper compartment are introduced figures
of Hercules wrestling with Antæus, Hercules riding
on a lion, and a combat between mounted pigmies.
The fables have also a large border surrounding the
first page of text, used again in the Hebrew Bible
of 1488. The ground-work of all the borders is<!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
black, but this has not always enabled them to
escape the hand of the colourist. The book is also
adorned by two large and two smaller printed
initials. To the same artist as the illustrator of
the <i>Æsop</i> must be attributed the title-cut of
Granollach's <i>Astrologia</i>, issued in or about the same
year. In 1486, again, Matthias Moravus printed
one of the few Italian <i>Horae</i>, a charming little book,
three inches by two, with sixteen lines of very
pretty Gothic type, printed in red and black, to
each of its tiny pages, and four little woodcuts,
which in the only copy I have seen have been
painted over. A daintier prayer-book can hardly
be conceived.</p>

<p>When we turn from the south to the north of
Italy, we find that an Italian printer at Verona had
preceded the German immigrants in issuing an
important work with really fine woodcuts as early
in 1472. This is the <i>De Re Militari</i> of Robertus
Valturius, written some few years previously, and
dedicated to Sigismund Malatesta. In this fine
book, printed by John of Verona, there are eighty-two
woodcuts representing various military operations
and engines, all drawn in firm and graceful
outline, which could hardly be bettered. The
designs for these cuts have been attributed to the
artist Matteo de' Pasti, whose skill as a painter,
sculptor, and engraver, Valturius had himself commended
in a letter written in the name of Malatesta
to Mahomet <span class="smcap">II.</span> The conjecture rests solely on this<!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
commendation, but seems intrinsically probable.
The book has no other adornment save these woodcuts
and its fine type. Another edition was printed
in the same town eleven years later by Boninus de
Boninis.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>Valturius</i>, the only other early Verona
book with illustrations known to me is an edition
of <i>Æsop</i> in the Italian version of Accio Zucco,
printed by Giovanni Alvisio in 1479. This has a
frontispiece in which the translator is seen presenting
his book to a laurel-crowned person sitting in a
portico, through which there is a distant view.
This is followed by a page of majuscules containing
the title of the book, but ending with a 'foeliciter
incipit.' On the back of this is a tomb-like erection,
bearing the inscription 'Lepidissimi Æsopi Fabellae,'
which gives it the rank of the second ornamental
title-page (see p. 32 for the first). Facing this is
a page surrounded by an ornamental border, at
the foot of which is the usual shield supported by
the usual naked boys. Within the border are
Latin verses beginning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Vt iuuet et prosit conatum pagina praesens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dulcius arrident seria picta iocis,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the lines being spaced out with fragments from the
ornamental borders which surround each of the
pictures in the body of the book. These, on the
whole, are not so good as those in the Naples edition
of 1485, but were helped out, at least in some copies,<!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
by rather pretty colouring. The chief feature in
the book is the care bestowed upon the preliminary
leaves.</p>

<p>In Florence, before 1490, we have no example of
wood-engraving employed in book illustration, but
in 1477, Nicolaus Lorenz of Breslau issued there
the first of three books with illustrations engraved
on copper. This is an edition of Bettini's <i>Monte
Santo di Dio</i> with three plates, representing respectively
(1) the Holy Mountain, up which a man is
climbing by the aid of a ladder of virtues; (2) Christ
standing in a 'mandorla' or almond-shaped halo
formed by the heads of cherubs; and (3) the torments
of Hell. This was followed in 1481 by a
<i>Dante</i> with the commentary of Landino, with engravings
illustrating the first eighteen cantos.
Spaces were left for engravings at the head of the
other cantos, but the plan was too ambitious, and
they were never filled up. Some copies of the book
have no engravings at all, others only two, those
prefixed to Cantos 1 and 3, the first of which is
most inartistically introduced on the lower margin
of the page, tempting mutilation by the binder's
shears. The other venture of Nicolaus Lorenz,
which has engraved work, is the <i>Sette Giornate della
Geographia</i> of Berlinghieri, in which he introduces
numerous maps.</p>

<p>At Milan only two illustrated books are known to
have been issued before 1490, both of which appeared
in 1479. The rarer of these, which is seldom found in<!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
perfect condition, is the <i>Summula di pacifica Conscientia</i>
of Fra Pacifico di Novara, printed by Philippus
de Lavagna, and illustrated with three copper-plates,
one of which represents the virtues of the Madonna,
the others containing diagrams exhibiting the prohibited
degrees of consanguinity. The other book
is a <i>Breviarium totius juris canonici</i>, printed by
Leonard Pachel and Ulrich Scinzenceller, with a
woodcut portrait of its author, 'Magister Paulus
Florentinus ordinis Sancti Spiritus,' otherwise Paolo
Attavanti.</p>

<p>The illustrated books printed in Italy which we
have hitherto noticed are of great individual interest,
but they led to the establishment of no school
of book-illustration, and the value of wood engravings
was as yet so little understood that the cuts
in them often failed to escape the hands of the
colourists. At Venice, on the other hand, where
Bernhard Maler and Erhard Ratdolt introduced
the use of printed initials and borders in 1476,
we find a continuous progress to the record of
which we must now turn. The border to the title-page
of the Kalendars of 1476 has already been
noticed: both the Latin and the Italian editions
also contained printed initials of a rustic shape,
resembling those in some early books in Ulm, but
larger and better. The next year the partners
made a great step in advance in the initials and
borders of an <i>Appian</i>, and an edition of Cepio's
<i>Gesta Petri Mocenici</i>. These were followed by an<!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
edition of <i>Dionysius Periegetes</i>, and in 1478 by the
<i>Cosmographia</i> of Pomponius Mela. Three distinct
borders are used in these books, all of them with
light and graceful floral patterns in relief on a black
ground. The large initials are of the same character,
and both these and the borders are unmistakably
Italian. In 1478 Ratdolt lost the aid of Bernhard
Maler, who up to that date seems to have been
the leading spirit of the firm, and the books subsequently
issued are much less decorative. In 1479
another German, Georg Walch, issued an edition of
the <i>Fasciculus Temporum</i> with illustrations mostly
poor enough, but with a quaint little attempt at
realism in one of Venice. These cuts of Walch's,
and also a decorative initial, Ratdolt was content to
copy on a slightly larger scale in an edition of his
own the next year. He also printed an undated
<i>Chiromantia</i>, with twenty-one figures of heads, a
reprint of which bearing his name and that of
Mattheus Cerdonis de Windischgretz was issued at
Padua in 1484. In 1482, came the <i>Poetica Astronomica</i>
of Hyginus, with numerous woodcuts of the
astronomical powers, those of Mercury (here very
slightly reduced) and Sol being perhaps the best.
To the same year belongs a reprint of the <i>Cosmographia</i>
of Pomponius Mela with a curious map
and a few good initials, also a <i>Euclid</i> with mathematical
diagrams and a border and initials from
the <i>Appian</i> of 1477.</p>

<p>After 1482 Ratdolt does not seem to have printed<!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
any new illustrated books, and in 1486 he ceased
printing at Venice and returned, as we have seen,
to Augsburg. Subject to the doubt as to whether
he has not been credited with praise which really
belongs to Bernhard Maler, his brief Italian career
entitles him to a place of some importance among
the decorators of books, for though his illustrations
were unimportant, his borders and initials
are among the best of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>In 1482 Octavianus Scotus printed three Missals
with a rude cut of the Crucifixion, and these were
imitated by other printers in 1483, 1485, and 1487.</p>

<p>The year 1486 was marked by the publication,
by Bernardino de Benaliis, of an edition of the
<i>Supplementum Chronicarum</i> of Giovanni Philippo
Foresti of Bergamo, with numerous outline woodcuts
of cities, for the most part purely imaginary
and conventional, the same cuts being used over
and over again for different places. Four years
later a new edition was printed by Bernardino de
Novara, in which more accurate pictures were substituted
in the case of some of the more important
towns, notably Florence and Rome. In both issues
the first three cuts, representing the Creation, the
Fall, and the sacrifice of Cain and Abel, are copied
from those in the Cologne Bible.</p>

<p>The year after his edition of the <i>Supplementum</i>,
Bernardinus de Benaliis printed an <i>Æsop</i> with sixty-one
woodcuts adapted from those in the Veronese
edition of 1479. Of this edition Dr. Lippmann, who<!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
had the only known copy under his charge at Berlin,
remarks that 'the style of engraving is, to a large
extent, cramped and angular, and the entire appearance
of the work is that of a genuine chapbook.'</p>

<p>In 1488 we arrive at the first of the numerous
illustrated editions of the <i>Trionfi</i> of Petrarch. This<!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
was printed by Bernardino de Novara, and has six
full-page cuts, measuring some ten inches by six,
and illustrating the triumphs of Love, of Chastity,
Death, Fame, and Time, and of the true Divinity
over the false gods. The designs are excellent, but
the engraver had very imperfect control over his
point, and his treatment of the eyes of the figures
introduced is by itself sufficient to spoil the pictures.
Curiously enough, the ornamental border of white
figures on a black ground is certainly better cut than
the pictures themselves.</p>

<span class="caption">From the <i>Devote Meditatione</i>, Venice, 1508 [1489].</span>
</div>

<p>The same inferiority of the engraver to the designer
is seen in the illustrations to the 1489 edition
of the <i>Deuote Meditatione sopra la passione del nostro
signore</i> attributed to S. Bonaventura. The first
illustrated edition of this book, with eleven illustrations
taken (slightly cut down) from the block book
of the Passion already mentioned, had been printed
in 1487 by Ieronimo de Santis. The 1489 edition
was printed by Matteo di Codecha (or Capcasa) of
Parma, who republished the book no less than six
times during the next five years, after which the
cuts were used by other printers,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> by Gregorio
di Rusconi, from whose edition in 1508 our illustration
of the mocking of Christ is taken. It is interesting
to compare this Venetian series with the
Florentine edition published a little later by Antonio
Mischomini, whose engraver, while taking many
hints from the designs of his predecessor, greatly
improved on them. The next year witnessed the<!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
first Venetian edition of another work in which
the artists of the two cities were to be matched
together. This is the <i>Fior di Virtù</i>, whose title-cut
of Fra Cherubino da Spoleto gathering flowers
in the convent garden shows a great advance on
previous Venetian work. Unfortunately the British
Museum copy has been slightly injured, so that I
am obliged to take my reproduction from the second
of two similar editions published by Matteo Codecha
in 1492, 1493. These have each thirty-six vignettes
in the text, illustrating the examples in the animal
world of the virtues which the author desired to
inculcate.</p>

</div>

<p>We must now turn to the first illustrated edition
of Malermi's Italian version of the Bible, printed in
1490. After the woodcut basis for the six little
illuminations in the Spencer copy of Adam of
Ammergau's edition of 1471, the first Biblical woodcuts
at Venice are a series of thirty-eight small
vignettes which decorate an edition of the <i>Postilla</i>
or sermons, of Nicolaus de Lyra, printed for
Octavianus Scotus in 1489. In the Bible itself,
printed the next year by Giovanni Ragazzo for
Lucantonio Giunta, the illustrations are on a very
lavish scale, numbering in all three hundred and
eighty-three, of which a few are duplicates, and
about a fourth are adapted in miniature from the
cuts in the Cologne Bibles, which formed a model
for so many other editions. Some of the best cuts
in this and other Venetian books are signed with<!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
a small <i>b</i>, which by some writers has been supposed
to stand for the name of the artist who designed
them, but is more probably to be referred to the
workshop at which they were engraved. The
craftsmen employed on the New Testament were
quite unskilled, but many of the illustrations to the
Old Testament are delightful. The first page of
the Bible is occupied by six somewhat larger cuts,
illustrating the days of Creation, joined together
within an architectural border. Other editions containing
the same cuts, with additions from other
books, were issued in 1494, 1498, and 1502. A
rival edition, printed by Guglielmo de Monteferrato,
with a new set of cuts of a similar character appeared
in 1493.</p>

<p>These three religious works, the <i>Meditatione</i>, the
<i>Postilla</i>, and the Malermi Bible thoroughly established
the use of vignettes, or small cuts worked
into the text, as an alternative to full-page illustrations,
like those in the <i>Petrarch</i>, and it was natural
that this method of decoration should soon be
applied to the greatest of Italian works, the <i>Divina
Commedia</i>. In producing an illustrated Dante,
Venice had been anticipated not only by the Florentine
edition of 1481, though the engravings in this
are only found in the first few cantos, but by a very
curious edition published at Brescia in 1487, with
full-page cuts, surrounded by a black border with
white arabesques. These large cuts, which measure
ten inches by six, are very coarsely executed, and<!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
have no merit save what the earlier ones derive
from their imitation of those in the Florentine
edition. In the course of the year 1491 two illustrated
<i>Dantes</i> were published at Venice, the first
on March 3rd by Bernardino Benali and Matteo
[Codecha] da Parma, the second on November 18th
by Pietro Cremonese. The earlier edition has a
fine woodcut frontispiece illustrating the first canto,
but the vignettes which succeed it are so badly cut
as to lose all their beauty. In the later edition the
same designs appear to have been followed, but
the vignettes are larger and much better cut, so
that they are at least somewhat less unworthy of
their subject. Both editions have printed initials,
but of the poorest kind, and in both the text is
hidden away amid the laborious commentary of
Landino.</p>

<p>After Dante's <i>Divina Commedia</i> it is natural to
expect an edition of Boccaccio's <i>Decamerone</i>, and
this duly followed the next year from the press of
Gregorius de Gregoriis. The first page is occupied
by a woodcut of the ten fine ladies and gentlemen
who tell the stories, seated in the beautiful garden
to which they had retired from the plague which
was raging around them. Beneath this are seventeen
lines of text, with a blank left for an initial
H, and woodcut and text are surrounded by an
architectural border, at the foot of whose columns
little boys standing on the heads of lions are
blowing horns, while in the lower section of the<!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
design the usual blank shield is approached from
either side by cupids riding on rams. The blank for
the initial is a great blot on the page, as any coloured
letter would have destroyed the delicacy of the whole
design. In the body of the work each of the ten
books is headed by a double cut, in one part of which
the company of narrators is standing in front of a
gateway, while one of their number is playing a
guitar; in the other they are all seated before a
fountain, presided over by a wreath-crowned master
of the story-telling. The vignettes which illustrate
the different tales vary very much in quality,
though some, like the little cut of the Marquis and
his friends approaching Griselda as she brings water
from the well, could hardly be bettered.</p>

<p>The <i>Boccaccio</i> of 1492 heralded a long series of
illustrated books from the press of Gregorius de
Gregoriis and his brother John. Most of these were
devotional in their character, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Zardine de Oratione</i>,
the <i>Monte dell' Oratione</i>, the <i>Vita e Miracoli del
Sancto Antonio di Padova</i>, the <i>Passione di Cristo</i>, &amp;c.
The <i>Novellino</i> of Masuccio Salernitano formed a
pendant to the <i>Boccaccio</i>, and was published in the
same year. To the Gregorii we also owe the magnificent
border, in white relief on a black ground, to
the Latin <i>Herodotus</i> of 1494, repeated again in the
second volume of the works of S. Jerome published
in 1497-98. Equally famous with any of these is
the same printer's series of editions of the <i>Fascicolo
de Medicina</i> of Johannes Ketham. In the first of<!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
these, printed in 1491, the illustrations are confined
to cuts of various dreadful-looking surgical instruments;
but in 1493 large pictures were added,
each occupying the whole of a folio page, and representing
a dissection, a consultation of physicians,
the bedside of a man struck down by the plague.
The dissection was printed in several colours, but
this experiment was abandoned, and a new block
was cut for the subsequent editions. In some of his
later books Gregorius repaired the mistake of the
<i>Boccaccio</i>, and used excellent woodcut initials.</p>

<p>The <i>Herodotus</i> of 1494 has only its magnificent
border by way of illustration, but other classical
authors received much more generous treatment
during this decade. An Italian <i>Livy</i>, with numerous
vignettes, was printed in 1493 by Giovanni di
Vercelli, and a Latin one in 1495 by P. Pincio,
Lucantonio Giunta in each case acting as publisher.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
In 1497 Lazarus de Soardis printed for
Simon de Luere a <i>Terence</i> with numerous vignettes;
and in the same year there appeared an illustrated
edition, several times reprinted, of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>
of Ovid, the printer being Giovanni Rossi
and the publisher once more Lucantonio Giunta.
The cuts in this work measure something over three
inches by five, and have little borders on each side
of them; but the fineness of the designs is lost by<!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
poor engraving. Some of them are signed <i>ia</i>,
others N.</p>

<p>We now approach one of the most famous books
in the annals of Venetian printing, the <i>Hypnerotomachia
Poliphili</i> printed by Aldus in 1499, at the
expense of a certain Leonardo Crasso of Verona,
'artium et iuris Pontificis consultus,' by whom it
was dedicated to Guidobaldo, Duke of Urbino.
The author of the book was Francesco Colonna, a
Dominican friar, who had been a teacher of rhetoric
at Treviso and Padua, and was now spending his
old age in the convent of SS. Giovanni e Paolo in
Venice, his native city. Colonna's authorship of
the romance is revealed in an acrostic formed by
the initial letters of the successive chapters, which
make up the sentence, 'Poliam Frater Franciscus
Columna peramavit': 'Brother Francesco Colonna
greatly loved Polia.' Who Polia was is a little
uncertain. In the opening chapter she tells her
nymphs that her real name was Lucretia, but she
has been identified with a Hippolita Lelio, daughter
of a jurisconsult at Treviso, who entered a convent
after having been attacked by the plague, which
visited Treviso from 1464 to 1468. On the other
hand, it is plausibly suggested that Polia (<a title="Greek: polia">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#945;</a>),
'the grey-haired lady,' is only a symbol of Antiquity,
and at the beginning of the book there is at least a
pretence of an allegory, though this is not carried
very far.</p>

<span class="caption">From the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>, Venice, 1499.</span>
</div>

<p>In the story Polifilo, a name intended to mean<!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
'the lover of Polia,' imagines himself in his dream
as passing through a dark wood till he reaches a
little stream, by which he rests. The valley
through which it runs is filled with fragments of
ancient architecture, which form the subjects of
many illustrations. As he comes to a great gate
he is frightened by a dragon. Escaping from this,
he meets five nymphs (the five senses), and is
brought to the court of Queen Eleuterylida (Free
Will). Then follows a description of the ornaments
of her palace and of four magnificent processions,
the triumphs of Europa, Leda, and Danaë, and the
festival of Bacchus. After this we have a triumph
of Vertumnus and Pomona, and a picture of nymphs
and men sacrificing before a terminal figure of
Priapus. Meanwhile Polifilo has met the fair Polia,
and together they witness some of the ceremonies
in the Temple of Venus, and view its ornaments
and those of the gardens round it. The first book,
which is illustrated with one hundred and fifty-one
cuts, now comes to an end. Book II describes
how the beautiful Polia, after an attack of the
plague, had taken refuge in a temple of Diana;
how, while there, she dreamt a terrifying dream
of the anger of Cupid, so that she was moved to let
her lover embrace her, and was driven from Diana's
temple with thick sticks; lastly, of how Venus took
the lovers under her protection, and at the prayer
of Polifilo caused Cupid to pierce an image of Polia
with his dart, thereby fixing her affections as<!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
firmly on Polifilo as he could wish&mdash;if only it were
not all a dream! This second book is illustrated
with only seventeen woodcuts, but as these are
not interrupted by any wearisome architectural
designs, their cumulative effect is far more impressive
than those of the first, though many of the
pictures in this&mdash;notably those of Polifilo in the
wood and by the river, his presentation to Eleuterylida,
the scenes of his first meeting with Polia, and
some of the incidents of the triumphs&mdash;are quite
equal to them. Unfortunately, the best pictures
in both books are nearly square, so that it is impossible
to reproduce them in an octavo except
greatly reduced.</p>

<p>The woodcuts of the <i>Polifilo</i> have been ascribed
to nearly a dozen artists, but in every case on the
very slenderest grounds. Some of the cuts, like
some of those in the Mallermi Bible, are marked
with a little <i>b</i>; but this, as has been said, is
almost certainly indicative of the engraver's workshop
from which they proceeded, rather than of
the artist who drew the designs. The edition of
1499 is a handsome folio; the text is printed in
fine Roman type, with three or four different
varieties of beautiful initial letters. The title and
headings are printed in the delicate majuscules
which belong to the type, and have a very graceful
appearance. A second edition of the <i>Polifilo</i> was
published in 1545, with, for the most part, the same
cuts. This was followed in the next year by a<!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
French translation by Jean Martin, printed at Paris
by Jacques Kerver, and republished three times
during the century. For the French editions the
cuts were freely imitated, the rather short, plump
Italian women reappearing as ladies of even excessive
height. In England in 1592 Simon Waterson
printed an abridged translation with the pretty
title, <i>Hypnerotomachia, or the Strife of Love in a
Dreame</i>, with a few cuts copied from the Italian
originals. The book, now extremely rare, was
apparently not well received, for Waterson, abandoning
all hope of a second edition, speedily parted
with his wood-blocks. Four of the cuts are found
amid the most incongruous surroundings in the
<i>Strange and wonderful tidings happened to Richard
Hasleton, borne at Braintree in Essex, in his ten yeares
trauailes in many forraine countries</i>, though this
egregious work was printed by A. I. for William
Barley in 1595, only three years after the <i>Strife of
Love in a Dreame</i>.</p>

<p>As we have noted, Aldus printed the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>
on commission, and save for two discreditably
bad cuts in his <i>Musaeus</i> and a rather
fine portrait of S. Catherine of Siena in his edition
of her Letters printed in 1500, he troubled himself
with no other illustrations. In his larger works he
revived the memory of the stately folios of Jenson,
and in his popular editions sought no other adornment
than the beauty of his italic type. If pictures
were needed to make a book more acceptable to a<!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
rich patron, he did not disdain to have recourse to
the illuminator. Some of his Greek books have
most beautiful initial letters, and in the Aristotle
of 1497 he employs good head-pieces, though these
fall far short of the large oriental design, printed
in red, placed by his friendly rival, Zacharias
Kaliergos, at the top of the first page of the <i>Commentary</i>
of Simplicius on Aristotle of 1499.</p>

</div>

<p>The influence of Aldus certainly helped to widen
the gulf which already existed between the finely
printed works intended for scholars and wealthy
book-lovers and the cheaper and more popular
ones in which woodcuts formed an addition very
attractive to the humbler book-buyers. Perhaps
this in part accounts for the great deterioration in
Italian illustrated books after the close of the fifteenth
century. The delicate vignettes and outline
cuts only appear in reprints, and in new works
their place is taken by heavily shaded engravings,
mostly of very little charm. The numerous liturgical
works published by Lucantonio Giunta and
his successors perhaps show this work at its best.
They are mostly printed in Gothic type with an
abundant use of red ink, and the heaviness of the
illustrations is thus all the better carried off. But
as the century advanced Venetian printing deteriorated
more and more rapidly: partly from
excessive competition; partly, as Mr. Brown has
shown in his <i>The Venetian Printing Press</i>, from too
much interference on the part of the Government;<!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
partly, we must suppose, simply from the decline
of good taste, though it is noticeable that between
1540 and 1560, when the insides of books had
become merely dull, is a brilliant period in the
history of Venetian binding. Whatever the cause,
within a few years after the close of the fifteenth
century the glories of Venetian printing had
disappeared.</p>

<p>We must now return from Venice to Florence, where,
after the experiments with engravings on copper
in 1477 and 1481, no illustrated books had been
published until on March 27, 1490, Francesco di
Dino (whom we have already seen at work at
Naples ten years earlier) brought out an edition of
the <i>Specchio di Croce</i> of Domenico Cavalca, with a
frontispiece representing the Crucifixion. In September
of the same year an edition of the <i>Laudi</i> of
Jacopone da Todi (the Franciscan author of the
<i>Stabat Mater</i>), was printed by Francesco Buonaccorsi,
which contains on the verso of its eighth leaf
a most beautiful outline woodcut,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> St. Jacopone
kneeling by a little lectern, his book on the ground,
while above him is a vision of the Madonna enshrined
in a 'mandorla,' supported below by three
cherubs and above by four maturer angels. In
1491 we make the acquaintance of Lorenzo di<!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Morgiani and Giovanni Tedesco da Maganza, or
Johann Petri of Mainz, from whose press some of
the most important of the Florentine illustrated
books were issued. The first result of their activity
was a new edition of Bettini's <i>Monte Santo di Dio</i>,
in which the three copperplates of the edition of
1477 were freely imitated upon wood. In the same
year they printed a little treatise on Arithmetic,
written by Philippo Calandro and dedicated to
Giuliano dei Medici. This is the most delightful
of all arithmetic books. It has a title-cut of
'Pictagoras Arithmetice Introductor,' and the
earlier pages of the book are surrounded by a
characteristic Renaissance border. Towards the
end of the work there is a series of illustrated
problems, only a little more absurd than those
which still occur in children's school-books. One
of these, however, is so good that we must permit
ourselves a little digression to quote it in a free
translation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A squirrel flying from a cat climbed to the top of a tree
26&frac34; arm's-lengths (<i>braccia</i>) in height. The cat, wanting to
seize the squirrel, began to climb the tree, and each day leaped
up half an arm's length, and each night descended a third of
one. The squirrel, on its part, believing that the cat had gone
away, wanted to get down from the tree, and each day descended
a quarter of an arm's length, and each night went
back one-fifth of one: I want to know in how many days the
cat will reach the said squirrel?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The answer is 121 days; but the picture must
have been taken on the first or second, for the cat<!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
is still very plump, and so large in proportion to
the tree that if he had but stood on his hind legs
he ought to have reached the top! Others of the
pictures are without this charming touch of absurdity,
perhaps the most perfect being a little cut
of a traveller on horseback, as to the expenses of
whose journey the teacher was anxious for some
information from his young friends. These little
cuts are all about an inch square, and drawn in
outline. Another edition of the Arithmetic, in
Roman type instead of black letter, but otherwise
very similar, was issued in 1518 by Bernardo
Zucchetta.</p>

<span class="caption">From an undated Savonarola tract, Florence, c. 1495.</span>
</div>

<p>With the year 1492 we come to the first dated
editions of the illustrated Savonarola tracts, which
play no inconsiderable part in the history of book
illustration in Italy. Their existence is in itself the
best refutation of the popular belief that the reformer's
influence was wholly hostile to the interests
of art, though the number of artists who reckoned
themselves, formally or informally, among his followers
should have sufficed to prevent the belief
growing up. These tracts, save for the cuts with
which they are adorned, are insignificant in appearance,
being for the most part badly printed,
and with few and poor initial letters. The woodcuts,
seldom more than two in a tract, are, however,
charming, and have won for them much
attention.</p>

<p>The first publisher of these tracts seems to have<!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
been Antonio Mischomini, who on June 26, 1492,
issued a</p>

<p>with the title arranged cross-wise, as here shown.
On the back of the title is a picture of the Crucifixion,
with the Blessed Virgin and S. John standing
by the Cross. This was followed on June 30th by
the <i>Tractato della humilta</i>, with a large title-cut
representing the dead Christ before His Cross, an
angel supporting each arm. Neither of these cuts
shows typical Florentine work, for the blank spaces
have all to be cleared away by the engraver, and
there is an abundance of shading. The first design
was clearly spoilt in the cutting, the second is of
great beauty. The typical Florentine work, in
which white lines are cut out from a black ground,
as well as black lines from a white, appears in the
<i>Tractato ouero Sermone della oratione</i>, finished by
Mischomini on October 20th. Here the title-cut
shows the scene at Gethsemane: the three disciples
asleep in the foreground, Christ in prayer, and the<!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
hands of an angel holding a cup appearing in a
corner above. The picture, as always in distinctively
Florentine work, is surrounded by a little
border or frame, in which a small white pattern is
picked out from a black ground.</p>

<p>The other illustrated Savonarola tracts bearing
an early date, with which I am acquainted, are the
<i>De Simplicitate Christianae Vitae</i>, printed 'impensis
Ser Petri Pacini,' August 28th, 1496, and the
<i>Predica dell arte del bene Morire</i>, preached on Nov.
2 of that year, taken down at the time by Ser
Lorenzo Violi, and doubtless published immediately
afterwards. The <i>De Simplicitate</i> has on its first
page a picture of a Dominican friar writing in his
cell, a sand-glass at his side, a crucifix in front of his
desk, and books and his gown scattered on a table.
The illustrations to the <i>Arte del bene Morire</i> comprise
a hideous outline cut of Death, scythe on shoulder,
flying over ground strewn with corpses (this is enclosed
in a large black border used by Mischomini
in 1492), and cuts of Death showing a young man
Heaven and Hell,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of a sick man with his good
and bad angels watching him and Death standing
without the door, and of a dying man attended by
a friar, Death sitting now at his bed's foot, and the
angels watching as before.</p>

<p>Turning now to the undated tracts, we find that
the <i>Expositione del Pater Noster</i> contains (1) a very<!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
beautiful variant of the representation of the scene
on Gethsemane, the angel appearing on the left
instead of the right,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> (2) a cut of S. James writing
at a table, (3) a small cut of David in prayer, and
some still smaller pictures of prophets and of the
Crucifixion. At the end of the book is an <i>Epistola
a una devota donna Bolognose</i>, which is headed and
ended by a cut of a Dominican preaching in the open
air to a congregation of nuns. An undated edition
of the <i>Tractato della Humilta</i> has Images of Pity at
the beginning and end, the former surrounded by
a black border. Yet another edition has an outline
cut of Christ holding His Cross, while blood
streams from His hand into a chalice. An edition
of the <i>Tractato dello Amore di Iesu</i> has two outline
cuts, one large, one small, showing the Blessed
Virgin and S. John standing by the Cross. A
tract on self-examination, addressed to the Abbess
of the Convent of the Murate at Florence, shows
an aged friar being welcomed at the convent. Other
tracts have pictures of a priest elevating the Host,
a man praying before an altar, a man and woman
praying, &amp;c. One of the rarest is the superb cut to
the <i>Dyalogo della Verita prophetica</i>, in which a friar
is preaching to seven questioners arranged in a half-circle
under a tree, a view of Florence occupying the
background. Cuts in other books show Savonarola<!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
meeting a devil and an astrologer, and represent
him preaching to an intent congregation. With
these tracts we must join the defence of Savonarola
by his follower Domenico Benivieni, who appears in
the title-cut in earnest disputation with a group of
Florentines, while later on in the book there is a full-page
illustration of the reformer's vision of the regeneration
of the world and the Church, in which the
stream of Christ's blood as He hangs on the Cross is
being literally used for the washing away of sins. This
book was published by Francesco Buonaccorsi in 1496.</p>

<p>Florentine book-illustration reached its highest<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>
in an edition of the <i>Epistole e Evangelii</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> or liturgical
Gospels and Epistles, printed in 1495 by Lorenzo
Morgiani and Johann Petri at the instance of the
Ser Piero Pacini da Pescia, who for the next fourteen
or fifteen years seems to have been an active promoter
of illustrated books. Only two copies of the
edition of the <i>Epistole e Evangelii</i> are known to
exist, but the owner of one of them, Mr. C. W.
Dyson Perrins, has reproduced all the woodcuts
in it in very finely executed facsimile, together with
a reprint of the text, for presentation to the Roxburghe
Club, so that the illustrator's work can
now be studied with comparative ease. The title-page
shows S. Peter and S. Paul standing in a circle
enclosed in an arabesque border of white floral
ornaments and dolphins on a black ground. At
the corners of the border are figures of the four<!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Evangelists. In the text there are twelve dozen
large woodcuts and two dozen half-length figures of
prophets, evangelists, and epistle-writers. Of the
larger cuts eleven represent S. Paul writing and one
S. Peter, most of the rest scenes from the life of
Christ, several of those representing the Passion
having previously appeared in an undated edition
of the <i>Meditatione</i> attributed to S. Bonaventura
from the press of Mischomini. The cuts form a
treasure-house of Florentine art, and were frequently
drawn upon by the printers of the later <i>Rappresentationi</i>,
at which we shall soon have to look.</p>

<p>We must return now to Antonio Mischomini, who
published many other illustrated books besides the
Savonarola tracts. In 1492 he printed an edition of
Cristoforo Landino's <i>Formulare di lettere e di orationi
uolgari</i>, with a large title-cut of a very young teacher
addressing a class, and at the end of the book his
mark (a cross-surmounted M within two squares
and a circle), surrounded by the arabesque border
which we have already noticed in the <i>Arte del bene
Morire</i> of 1496. The next year (<i>i.e.</i> 1493) he printed
the <i>Libro di Giuocho delli Scacchi</i> of Jacobus de
Cessolis, with a large title-cut (repeated at the end
of the book) representing courtiers playing in the
presence of a king, and thirteen smaller cuts personifying
the various pieces. These comprise a
king and queen, a judge, a knight, a 'rook,' or
vicar of the king to visit in his stead all parts of the
realm, and the eight 'popolari' or pawns, a labourer,<!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
smith, wool-merchant, money-changer, physician,
tavern-keeper (here shown), city-guard, and a runner
to be at the rook's service. Chess-players may be
interested to know that the pawns actually in use
in 1493, as shown on the board in the title-cut, had
already lost this excessive individuality, and resemble
those of our own day.</p>

<span class="caption">From the <i>Fior di Virtù</i>, Florence, 1498.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1494 Mischomini printed the commentary on
the Ten Commandments by Frate Marco dal Monte
Sancta Maria, which has a title-cut of the friar
preaching, and three full-page allegorical illustrations
freely copied from those in an edition
printed at Venice. The first of these represents
'la figura della vita eterna' by a picture of the
glories of heaven,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the earthly devotions by
which they are to be attained; the second, which
is in three divisions, the traversing of the Desert
of Sin; and the third, Mount Sinai, up which Moses
is seen climbing. In the same year, 1494, Mischomini
also published a catechism known as the
<i>Lucidario</i>, to which he prefixed a title-cut showing
Damocles at his feast, the sword hanging over his
head, and in another compartment some little
rabbits running happily in a wood. Damocles and
the rabbits have nothing whatever to do with the
Catechism, and the occurrence of the cut proves
that before this date Mischomini must have printed<!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
an edition of the <i>Fior di Virtù</i>, to which it rightfully
belongs. We have already looked at the
Venetian editions of this book, and shall not be
surprised to find that the Florentine printers had
the good sense to copy their charming title-cut,
though they did not improve it by their addition of
an incongruous border of pilasters, a vernicle, and
an Image of Pity. The first Florentine edition of
this book, with which I am acquainted, has a fitfully
rhyming colophon, adapted from that of the
Venetian edition of 1493, showing that it was
printed at Florence in 1498, and ought, at any rate,
to be read on feast-days. To entice readers to persevere
in this task, there are thirty-five illustrations,
some of which, like the one in the <i>Lucidario</i>, are<!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
divided into two parts, so as to secure a contrast
or comparison between an animal and a man&mdash;as,
for example, between a humble sheep and a proud
general riding in triumph, or, as shown in our illustration,
between the constancy of the ph&oelig;nix,
who permits herself to be burnt to ashes rather than
quit her nest, and that of an Emperor Constantine
who (by a gross plagiarism upon Solon) quitted his
country for ever, after making his counsellors swear
to observe his laws unaltered until his return. The
book was printed yet a third time, probably about
1515, by Gian Stephano da Pavia, at the request of
Bernardo Pacini. The printer of the 1498 edition
is not known; it cannot have been Mischomini,
who seems to have brought his brilliant career to
a close about 1495. The foregoing notice of his
illustrated books is by no means exhaustive. Passing
mention has been made in the chapter on Venice
of one other important one, the undated <i>Meditatione</i>,
attributed to S. Bonaventura, with cuts of peculiar
interest, from the opportunity they afford of comparing
the different styles in vogue in the two cities.</p>

<p>Three other Florentine books issued during the
fifteenth century remain to be mentioned, none of
which I have seen. The first of these, an undated
edition of Domenico Capranica's <i>Arte di bene Morire</i>
(not to be confounded with Savonarola's), published
by Morgiani and Johann Petri about 1495, contains
twelve large cuts and twenty-two small ones. The
larger cuts are interesting, because ten of them are<!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
based on those found in the old block books of the
<i>Ars Moriendi</i>, the other two coming from Savonarola's
book of the same name. The smaller ones
seem brought together rather at haphazard. The
other two books, an <i>Æsop</i>, printed in 1495 by
Francesco Buonaccorsi for Piero Pacini, and the
<i>Morgante Maggiore</i> (a long poem on the adventures
of Orlando) of Ludovico Pulci, printed in 1500, both
exist only in single copies in foreign libraries, but
a good many illustrations from both have been
reproduced by Dr. Kristeller.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<a href="images/i_132.jpg"><img src="images/i_132_tn.jpg" width="283" height="400" alt="" title="linked to larger image" /></a>
</div>

<p>Of illustrated books printed at Florence after
1500, the most important is an edition of the
<i>Quatriregio del decorso della vita humana</i> of Federico
Frezzi, printed, this also, 'ad petitione di Ser Piero
Pacini di Pescia,' as late as 1508, though there is
ground for believing that this may really be a
reprint from a fifteenth century edition now no
longer extant. Like the author of the <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>,
Frezzi was a Dominican, and was consecrated
Bishop of Foligno, his native place, in 1403.
He attended the Council of Constance, and died
there in 1416. He was a man of great learning
and a book-collector, but rather a dull poet. His
<i>Quatriregio</i> is an imitation of Dante's <i>Divina Commedia</i>,
and is divided into four books treating
successively of the kingdoms 'of the god Cupid,'
'of Satan,' 'of the Vices,' and 'of the goddess
Minerva and of Virtue.' It was first printed in
1481, and went through three other editions before<!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
it was honoured with illustrations. The importance
of this illustrated edition has perhaps been
overrated. Taken individually, the best of the
cuts are not superior to those in earlier Florentine
books of less pretensions, while the cumulative
effect of the series of one hundred and twenty-six
(several of which, it should be said, are duplicates)
is seriously diminished, partly by the monotonous
recurrence of the same figure in every cut, partly
by the coarseness and angularity with which most
of the blocks have been engraved. It must be
mentioned that the cut on the first page of the poem
is signed with the initials L. V., which were at one
time interpreted as standing for Luca Egidio di
Venturi, <i>i.e.</i> Luca Signorelli, whose recognised signature,
however, was L. C. (Luca di Cortona).</p>

<p>Two other great series of Florentine illustrated
books still remain to be considered. The first of
these is the <i>Rappresentazioni</i>, sacred and secular,
which enjoyed a life extending over two centuries,
and must be reckoned as the most artistic of chapbooks.
In 1852 M. Colomb de Batines published
at Florence a bibliography of these 'Antiche Rappresentazioni
Italiane,' to which I am indebted for
the following details concerning their chief authors.
The plays are almost uniformly written in <i>ottava
rima</i>, and poorly printed in double columns. A
large number of them, at least a score, were written
and printed during the fifteenth century, but these
earliest editions are, as a rule, not illustrated.<!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Maffeo Belcari (1410-1484) apparently was the first
author who obtained the honours of print. His
play of <i>Abraham</i> appeared in 1485, after which it
was reprinted some twenty times, the latest known
edition belonging to the eighteenth century. Belcari
also wrote on the Annunciation, on S. John
the Baptist visited by Christ in the Desert, and on
S. Panuntius. Lorenzo de' Medici himself wrote
a play of S. John and S. Paul, Bernardo Pulci
(d. 1501) produced one on the legend of Barlaam
and Josaphat, while his wife Antonia was quite a
prolific dramatist, claiming as her own plays on
S. Domitilla, S. Guglielma, the Patriarch Joseph,
S. Francis, and the Prodigal Son. During the
fifteenth century anonymous plays were written
on the Nativity, on the life of Queen Hester, on the
Angel Raphael, on the conversion of three robbers
by S. Francis, and on S. Eustachio, S. Antony,
and S. Antonia. Plays on the Last Judgment,
on S. Agatha, S. Agnes, S. Catharine, S. Cecilia,
S. Christina, &amp;c., also appeared at an early date.
An angel, as a rule, acts as Prologue, and the action
of the drama is divided between numerous characters.
Most of the plays were, doubtless, intended
to be acted on the feast-day of the Saint whose life
they celebrate, and in a church bearing the Saint's
name, but the multiplicity of the editions show
that they also won the favour of a reading public.</p>

<p>A few undated editions of these little books,
from the types used in their press work, may be<!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
assigned to the end of the fifteenth century. The
first printer who is known to have made a specialty
of the <i>Rappresentazioni</i> is Francesco Benvenuto,
who began printing them in 1516, and enjoyed a
career of thirty years. M. Colomb de Batines
mentions several of his editions, but they are very
scarce, and I have only myself seen a <i>Raphael</i> of
1516 with a title-cut of Tobit and the Angel enclosed
in a border, partly the same as that of the
<i>Fior di Virtù</i> of 1498, a <i>Barlaam</i> and <i>Josafat</i>, also
of 1516, with six illustrations (including our friend
Damocles and the Rabbit, whose fate seems to have
been to be lugged in inappropriately), and a <i>Miracolo
di Tre Peregrini che andauano a sancto Iacopo di
Galitia</i>, with a solitary cut of the Saint rescuing
one of the pilgrims who is being unjustly hanged.
The great majority of the extant <i>Rappresentazioni</i>
were printed between 1550 and 1580, mostly
anonymously, though Giovanni Baleni and a printer
'Alle Scale di Badia' were responsible for a great
many of them. Of course, in many cases the cuts
were sadly the worse for wear, but they held on
wonderfully, and even in the seventeenth century
editions a tolerable impression is sometimes met
with. Many of them, also, were recut, sometimes
skilfully, so that it is not uncommon to find a
better example in a later edition than in an earlier.
The illustrations here shown are from an undated
edition of Lorenzo de' Medici's <i>Rappresentatione di
San Giovanni e Paulo</i>, the careful printing of which<!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
is an argument for its belonging to the beginning
of the sixteenth century, and a picture of the
martyrdom of S. Dorothea from an edition of her
<i>Rappresentatione</i> printed in 1555.</p>

<span class="caption">Martyrdom of S. Dorothea.</span>
</div>

<p>With these religious <i>Rappresentazioni</i> M. Colomb
de Batines joins a few secular poems, whose title
to be considered dramatic is not very clear. Of
those which he mentions, the earliest is the <i>Favola
d' Orfeo</i>, by Angelo Politiano, which forms part of
<i>La Giostra di Giuliano di Medici</i>, printed without
name or date, probably about 1495, with ten
excellent cuts, that of Aristeo pursuing the flying
Eurydice being, perhaps, the best. <i>La Giostra di
Lorenzo di Medici</i>, celebrated by Luigi Pulci, has
only a single cut, but that a fine one&mdash;a meeting
of knights in an amphitheatre. Among other
secular chapbooks which enjoyed a long popularity
was a series of 'contrasti,'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the contrast of Carnival
and Lent, of Men and Women, of the Living and
the Dead, of the Blonde and the Brunette, and of
Riches and Poverty. I give here the first of the two
cuts of the <i>Contrasto di Carnesciale e la Quaresima</i>,
undated, but probably early. With these little
poems we must join the metrical <i>Novelle</i> and
<i>Istorie</i>, now chiefly known through the discovery
in the University Library at Erlangen of a little
collection of twenty-one tracts, all undated, and<!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
without any indication of their printers, but which
may mostly be assigned to the end of the fifteenth
century. Among them are the <i>Novella di Gualtieri
e Griselda</i>, the <i>Novella di due Preti et un Cherico</i>,
the <i>Novella della Figliuola del Mercatante</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The charm of these little Florentine books is so
great, and of late years has won such steadily
increasing recognition, that I do not think an
apology is needed for the length at which they have
here been treated. None the less, we must remember
that they were essentially popular books,
and that the wealthy book lovers of the time probably
regarded them very slightly. Mischomini
himself did not turn his attention to them till he
had been printing nearly a dozen years, and even
after 1492 his more expensive books, the great
<i>Plotinus</i>, for instance, issued in that year, kept
strictly to the traditions of twenty years earlier,
and were wholly destitute of ornament, even of
printed initials. The two classes of books&mdash;those
on good paper and in a large handsome type, and
those on poor paper with small type carelessly
printed, but with delightful woodcuts&mdash;were issued
side by side, but the beauties of the two were never
combined, and the Florentine printers would doubtless
have been greatly surprised if they had been
told that it was the chapbooks which were to win
the day. Even in the little italic editions issued by
the Giuntas, in imitation of Aldus, which appealed
to an intermediate class of purchasers, woodcuts<!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
occur but rarely, and the only instance I can call
to mind is a <i>Dante</i>, printed by Philippo Giunta in
1506, which, besides some plans of the <i>Inferno</i>, &amp;c.,
has a single cut illustrating the first canto.</p>

<p>We have devoted so much space to Venice and
Florence that the illustrated books of other towns
must be noticed with rather unfair brevity. Brescia
may be taken as an example of a town at which the
native artist did his best. We have already remarked
the publication there of a <i>Dante</i> in 1487.
The same year witnessed the appearance of an
<i>Æsop</i>, rudely imitated from the Verona edition,
and in 1491 Baptista da Farfengo printed another
book in which we have been interested, a <i>Fior di
Virtù</i>, with a title-cut of a student, head on hand,
reading at a desk. On a ledge on the wall are two
flower-pots, the flowers in which reach up to a very
decorative ceiling. This is quite a nice example
of Brescian art, but the productions of the town
have not been specially studied, and further research
might show that they deserve more serious
praise. At Ferrara artists of the schools of Venice
and Florence appear to have combined in the
production of some very notable books. Two of
these were published by Lorenzo di Rossi in 1497.
The first is an edition of the Epistles of S. Jerome,
with numerous vignettes and three frontispieces,
the third of which, somewhat in the style of the
Venetian Boccaccio, bears the date 1493, divided
between its two columns. This frontispiece appears<!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
also in the other work, the <i>De pluribus claris selectisque
mulieribus</i> of Philippus Bergomensis, the
illustrations in the text of which show Florentine
influence in their black backgrounds. This book
has a title-page printed in large Gothic letters cut
in wood, similar to that of the <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>No illustrated books appear to have been issued
at Milan during the eighties, but in 1492 Philippo
Mantegazza printed the <i>Theorica Musice</i> of Gafori
with some coarse cuts, and this was followed in
1494 by the <i>Triumfi</i> of Petrarch, printed by Antonio
Zaroto with the usual six full-page illustrations.
As befits the reputation of Milan as a musical centre,
the works of Gafori were often printed there. In
1496 Guillaume Le Signerre of Rouen printed there
the first edition of the <i>Practica Musice</i>, with a
curious title-page representing the relations of the
Muses and the heavenly bodies, and fine ornamental
borders to two pages of text. At the base
of one of these are little scenes of choir-boys
practising and a music-mistress giving a lesson.
The style of the borders is distinctly Venetian.
In another work of Gafori's printed at Milan, the
<i>De Harmonia Instrumentorum</i> of 1518 (reprinted
two years later at Turin), the cuts exhibit the heavy
Milanese shading, one of them representing a lesson
on the organ, and the other a performer playing.</p>

<p>In 1496 Le Signerre printed a devotional work,
the <i>Specchio di Anima</i> of Besalii, with seventy-eight
full-sized cuts to its eighty-eight pages. Most of<!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the cuts relate to the passion of Christ, and they are
described by Dr. Lippmann as 'vigorously executed
in coarse thick outlines, with scarcely any
shading.' Some of these cuts reappear three years
later in the same printer's <i>Tesauro Spirituale</i>, of
which the unique copy is in the Berlin Print-Room.
In 1498 Le Signerre printed an <i>Æsop</i>, the cuts in
which are surrounded by small black borders
relieved in white. The illustrations themselves are
poor. At the end of the book is the printer's mark,
a crowned stork in a shield within a circle, on either
side of which stand a fox and a monkey. In this<!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
same year Le Signerre transferred his press to
Saluzzo, where in 1499 he issued the <i>Tesauro Spirituale</i>,
and four years later an edition of the <i>De
Veritate Contricionis</i> of Vivaldus, with a fine frontispiece
representing S. Jerome in the desert. The
border shows typical Milanese ornament, and recalls
the illumination to the <i>Sforziada</i>, mentioned in our
first chapter. In 1507 a still finer work, an edition
of the <i>Opus Regale</i>, also by Vivaldus, was printed
at Saluzzo by Jacobus de Circis. This contains a
fine picture of Saint Louis of France in prayer, and<!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
also a large portrait of the Marquis of Saluzzo,
Louis <span class="smcap">II.</span>, whose taste has won for the town its little
niche in the history of printing.</p>

<p>Italian printers' devices are very decorative and
interesting, and may now be studied in Dr. Paul
Kristeller's 'Die italienischen Buchdrucker- und
Verlegerzeichen,' which gives nearly a complete collection
of those in use before 1525, to the number
of between three and four hundred. In the great
majority of devices the ground is black, with a
simple design, mostly including a circle and a cross,
outlined in white. The mark of Bazalerius de Bazaleriis
of Bologna and Reggio, taken from a copy
of the <i>Epistolae</i> of Philelphus, printed by him in
1489, shows this class of design in almost its<!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
simplest form. In that of Stephanus Guillireti,
who printed at Rome from 1506 to 1524, we have
the addition of a shield (the arms on which, unluckily,
have not been identified) and floral sprays.
These floral sprays become the chief feature in the
design of Franciscus de Mazalis of Reggio, who
printed from 1493 to 1504; though the initials,
circle, and cross of the simpler devices are all retained.
An even more beautiful example of this<!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
class of mark was used by Egmont and Barrevelt,
the printers of the Sarum Missal, who added to its
attractiveness by the use of red ink, instead of
black. Red ink also adds immensely to the effect
of the well-known mark of Nikolaos Blastos, which
occurs in a copy of the Commentary of Simplicius
upon Aristotle, printed by Zacharias Kaliergos at
Venice in 1499. The delicate tracery of this design
is unsurpassed by any work of the time. The mark
of Nicolaus Gorgonzola, who printed at Milan from
1504 to 1533, in its floral ornaments, is very
similar in style to those of Mazalis and Egmont,
but, as in the mark of Blastos, the cross and circle<!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
have disappeared, and the name is set out in full,
instead of by its initials.</p>

<p>Purely ornamental designs, of the styles illustrated
in these five examples, form the majority
among Italian devices, but more pictorial ones were
by no means unknown. One of the best of these was
that used by 'Simon de Gabiis dictus Bevilaqua,'
who printed at Venice from 1485 to about 1512.
Another good device is that of Ser Piero di Pacini
of Pescia, the publisher of so many of the Florentine
illustrated books. This consists of a crowned dolphin
on a black ground, with sometimes a smaller
device of a bird, placed on each side of it.<!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

As examples of later styles, though not very
beautiful in themselves, we add here the rather
clumsy woodcut of S. Nicholas adopted by Niccolò
d'Aristotele da Ferrara, called 'il Zoppino,' who
printed at Venice from 1508 to about 1536, and the
very florid device of Hieronymus Francisci Baldassaris,
a printer at Perugia from about 1526 to
1550. The arms there shown are those of the city
of Perugia, while the F. and the cross above it
reproduce the mark used by the printer's father,
Francesco, the founder of the firm. The Aldine
anchor and the <i>fleur-de-lys</i> of Lucantonio Giunta
and his successors are too well known to need
reproduction or comment, though both stand rather
apart from the ordinary run of Italian marks.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>FRANCE&mdash;FIFTEENTH CENTURY</h3>


<p>The earliest productions of the French press will
not bear comparison with those of either the German
or the Italian: they have neither the massive dignity
of the one, nor the artistic grace of the other.
The worthy professors at the Sorbonne, who called
to their aid the Swiss or German printers, Crantz
Gering and Friburger, bestowed, as we have seen
in our first chapter, considerable trouble on the
decoration by hand of special copies for presentation
to influential friends or patrons, but in other
respects, their books were wholly destitute of ornament.
When, after little more than two years, they
gave up their press, the three printers started again
on their own account with a rather ugly gothic type,
nor did Gering, who afterwards worked both by
himself and in combination with other printers,
produce a really handsome book until about 1480.
The semi-gothic types of another firm of German
printers in Paris, Peter Caesaris and Stoll, are much
more attractive, but the average French work
during the seventies is dull.</p>

<p>The first attempt at decoration appears to have
been made, not at the capital, but at Lyons, where,<!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
in August 1478, an anonymous printer, probably
Martin Husz, completed a double-column edition of
<i>Le Miroir de la redemption humaine</i>, translated from
the Latin by Julien Macho, with cuts previously
used in a German edition of the <i>Speculum</i>, printed
at Basel in 1476. In 1478, also, Barthélemy Buyer
printed an edition of the romance of <i>Baudoin, Comte
de Flandre</i>, with no cuts, but with rude printed
initials. In an edition of <i>Les Quatre Filz Aymon</i>,
unsigned and undated, but printed at Lyons about
1480, the first page bears four grotesque woodcuts
representing the reception of the youths by Charlemagne,
the buffet which the Emperor's son gave
one of them over a game of chess, the fatal blow
with the golden chess-board by which the buffet
was returned, and then the four youths fighting
amid a crowd. On the next page a larger picture
shows their expulsion from Charlemagne's court.
Throughout the book are curious woodcut initials,
interwoven with grotesque faces. About 1481
Ortuin and Schenck produced (anonymously) an
edition of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i> with eighty-six small
woodcuts, which were imitated in later editions both
at Lyons and Paris, and were not without a certain
rude merit. In 1483 Mathieu Husz and Pierre
Hongre issued a <i>Légende dorée</i>, with large pictures
of Christ in Glory on the Last Day, and of the
Crucifixion, and numerous very rough cuts at the
head of the different chapters. In the same year,
Husz published, in conjunction with Jean Schabeler,<!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
an illustrated translation of Boccaccio's <i>De Casibus
illustrium virorum</i> ('Du dechier des nobles hommes
et femmes'). Meanwhile, at Albi, in Languedoc,
of all places in the world, Neumeister had reprinted
in 1481 an illustrated edition of the <i>Meditationes</i> of
Turrecremata, which he had produced two years
previously at Mainz. In 1484 we hear of illustrated
books in three other towns. At Rennes, Pierre
Bellescullée and Josses printed the <i>Coutumes de
Bretagne</i>, with a woodcut of the arms of Brittany,
used again the next year in the same printers'
<i>Floret en francoys</i>, a book noticeable for having a
woodcut title printed in white on a black ground.
At Vienne, Pierre Schenck printed another edition,
in double-columns, of <i>L'Abuzé en court</i>, with small
cuts at the chapter headings. At Chambéry,
Antoine Neyret finished, on July 6th, an edition of
the <i>Exposition des Évangiles en romant</i> of Maurice de
Sully, and in the following November the romance
of <i>Baudoin comte de Flandre</i>. The Bishop's sermons
have, on the first page, a large initial I and a very
rough cut of the disciples loosing the ass and her
colt for Christ's use. With their other illustrations
I am not acquainted. The romance of Count
Baldwin has a full-page cut of the Count riding on a
gaily-decked charger, and thirteen smaller illustrations
of his adventures, of which, however, several
are repeated. The execution of them all is as rude
as can well be conceived. Two years later, Neyret
printed the first edition of a very famous book, <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span><i>Le
Livre du Roi Modus et de la reine Ratio</i>, 'lequel fait
mencion commant on doit deviser de toutes manières
de chasses.' The cuts in this are numerous, and
their representations of the various hunting scenes
are more than sufficiently grotesque.</p>

<p>The list of books we have named could certainly
be extended, especially as regards those printed at
Lyons, but it is sufficiently full to enable us to
draw some useful conclusions from it. The illustrations
are, almost without exception, poor in
design and badly cut, and are mostly accompanied
by inferior types and press-work. Some of them are
imitated from the books of foreign printers, and
they contain little evidence of the growth of any
French school of illustrators. On the other hand,
they testify to the spread of a demand for illustrated
books, at least in the provinces, which local printers
were doing their best to satisfy. At Paris the demand,
apparently, had not yet arisen. In the first
dated book which bears the name of Jean du Pré,
a <i>Missale ad usum ecclesiae Parisiensis</i>, printed by
him in conjunction with Didier Huym in September
1481, there is a large woodcut of God the Father
and the Crucifixion, illustrating the Canon. Two
months later Du Pré printed a Verdun missal with
a really fine metal cut of a priest at Mass, and a
little figure rising up to represent his soul in prayer.
In February 1483-4 appeared his first illustrated
secular work, <i>De la ruine des nobles hommes</i>, another
translation from Boccaccio's <i>De Casibus</i>, with a<!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
woodcut of varying merit at the head of each book.
These have a special interest for English students,
as some years later they were borrowed by Pynson
to illustrate his edition of Lydgate's version of the
same work.</p>

<p>In May 1484 Jacques Bonhomme issued Millet's
<i>L'Histoire de la destruction de Troye la Grant</i>, with
numerous woodcuts of battles, frequently used in
later works; and the following year Guyot Marchant
produced the first of numerous editions of a <i>Danse
Macabre</i> illustrated with a wonderful series of
pictures, full of grotesque vigour and skilfully cut,
showing Death as a grinning skeleton seizing on his
prey in every class of society. Marchant followed
this up with a <i>Danse Macabre des femmes</i> (somewhat
less good) in 1491, and also with a <i>Compost
et Calendrier des Bergers</i>, which was no less
successful.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the greatest Paris publisher of the
century, Antoine Vérard, had come on the scene.
Although some of the innumerable works which
bear his name are said to have been printed '<i>par</i>
Antoine Vérard,' it is clear that the expression must
not be taken too literally, and that he was a 'libraire,'
<i>i.e.</i> a bookseller or publisher, rather than a printer.
His first dated book is an edition, enriched with a
single woodcut, of Laurent du Premier Fait's French
version of the <i>Decamerone</i>, and the colophon tells
us that it was printed for Antoine Vérard, 'libraire,
demeurant sur le Pont Notre Dame, à l'image de<!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Saint Jean l'Evangéliste,' on November 22, 1485.
The types used in the book have been identified as
belonging to Jean du Pré, and the association of the
two men seems to have led to important results.
The next year we find Du Pré printing an edition
of S. Jerome's <i>Vie des anciens saintz Pères</i>, with a
delightful frontispiece of the saint preaching from a
lectern in the open air, numerous smaller cuts, and
initial letters with interwoven faces. During 1486
also, he assisted Pierre Gérard (who earlier in
the year had printed by himself an edition of
Boutillier's <i>La Somme Rurale</i> with a single cut), in
producing at Abbeville the first really magnificent
French illustrated book, S. Augustine's <i>Cité de Dieu</i>,
in which paper and print and woodcuts of artistic
value all harmonise.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Two years later he joined
with another provincial printer, Jean le Bourgeois, in
producing a still more splendid book, the romance
of <i>Lancelot du Lac</i>, the first volume of which was
finished by Le Bourgeois at Rouen on November
24th, and the second by Du Pré at Paris on September
16th. In 1488 also, Du Pré produced his
first 'Book of Hours,' but the French <i>Horae</i> form
so important an episode in the history of the decoration
of books, that we must reserve their treat<!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ment
for a separate chapter, in which, besides those
of Du Pré and Vérard, we shall have to speak of the
long series inaugurated by Philippe Pigouchet and
Simon Vostre in 1491.</p>

<p>At starting, Vérard's resources were probably
small, and for a year or two he produced little
beyond his <i>Horae</i>. In 1487, however, he published
a French <i>Livy</i>, with four small cuts, representing a
battle, a siege, a king and his court, and some
riders, whose hats have a very ecclesiastical shape,
entering a town. The next year produced a work
entitled <i>L'art de Chevalerie selon Végèce</i>, really an
edition of the <i>Faits d'arme et de chevalerie</i> of Christine
de Pisan. This has a single large cut representing
a king and his court. The <i>Livre de Politiques
d'Aristote</i>, published in 1489, has a large frontispiece
of the translator, Nicholas Oresme, presenting
his book to Charles <span class="smcap">VIII</span>, in which the characteristic
style of Vérard's artist is fully developed.
In 1490, an edition of <i>Lucain, Suetone et Saluste</i>,
which I have not seen, was printed for Vérard by
Pierre Le Rouge. To 1491 probably belongs his
French <i>Seneca</i>, and in this year he must have
obtained the aid of the king or of some very rich
patron, for his activity from 1492 to the end of
the century is quite amazing. It is from about
1493, also, that we may date the production of those
magnificent special copies on vellum, enriched with
elaborate, if not very artistic, miniatures, to which
we have already alluded in our first chapter.<!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief book of 1492 was undoubtedly the series
of treatises making up the <i>Art de bien vivre et de
bien mourir</i>, of which a detailed description will be
given later on. These treatises were printed for
Vérard by Cousteau and Menard, the first part
being finished on July 18th, the last on December
19th. Next to them in importance is a <i>Josephus de
la bataille judaique</i>, one of Vérard's large folios, with
columns of printed text, not reckoning any margin,
nearly twelve inches long. The frontispiece is a
fine cut of a triumphal entry of a king who should
be French, since he wears the lilies. The design,
however, must have been made for this book, for
a label in the middle of the picture bears the name
'Josephus,' while in the <i>Gestes Romaines</i> and
<i>Lancelot</i>, in both of which the cut reappears, the
label is left blank. The 'Entry' is also used again,
three times in the <i>Josephus</i> itself, at the beginning
of the fourth, fifth, and seventh books. An entry
of a different kind, that of Joshua and his staff into
Jericho, is depicted in the cut (here reproduced)
which heads the prologue. This is faced by the
first page of text, headed by a cut of an author
presenting his book to an ecclesiastic. Both pages
are surrounded by fine borders of flowers, women,
and shield. The head-cut to the second book shows
a monk handing a book to a king; that used for the
third and sixth (repeated again in the <i>Lancelot</i> of
1494) shows a king on his throne surrounded by
his courtiers, a sword of justice is in his hand, and<!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
a suppliant kneels before him. Small cuts, fitting
into the columns, head the different chapters in
each book, but are of no great merit. Occasionally
a border about an inch wide runs up the side of one
of the columns of text, usually on the outer margin,
but sometimes on the inner. Altogether the book
is a very notable one.</p>

<span class="caption">From Vérard&#39;s <i>Josephus</i>, 1492. (Much reduced.)</span>
</div>

<p>In 1493, Vérard's activity was still on the increase,
and we have at least eight illustrated books of his
bearing the date of this year. In the romance of
<i>Le Jouvencel</i> and Bonnor's <i>Arbre des Batailles</i>, both
in 4to, the cuts, all of them small, are nearly
identical, and are repeated again and again in each
book. Much more important than these are the
editions of the <i>Chronicques de France</i> (printed for
Vérard by Jehan Maurand), and a translation of
the Metamorphoses of Ovid, issued under the very
taking title of <i>La Bible des Poetes</i>. This is another
of Vérard's great folios, with profuse illustrations,
large and small, and in its vellum edition is a very
gaudy and magnificent book. In 1494 Vérard
published his <i>Lancelot</i>; and in 1495, a <i>Légende
Dorée</i> and S. Jerome's <i>Vie des Pères en françois</i>.
This last book was finished on October 15, but its
appearance was preceded by that of the first volume
of the publisher's most ambitious undertaking, an
edition of the <i>Miroir Historial</i> of Vincent de
Beauvais. This enormous chronicle is in thirty-two
books, which Vérard divided between five
great folio volumes, averaging about three hundred<!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span><!-- Page 151 --><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>
and twenty leaves, printed in long double columns.
The whole work thus contains about the same
amount of matter as some fifty volumes of the
present series, yet it was faultlessly printed on the
finest vellum, and with innumerable woodcuts,
subsequently coloured, in considerably less than a
year. The first volume was finished on September
29, 1495, and the colophon which announces the
completion of the last, 'à l'honneur et louenge de
nostre seigneur iesucrist et de sa glorieuse et sacrée
mere et de la court celeste de paradis,' bears date
May 7th, 1496. In the face of such activity and
enterprise, I feel ashamed of having girded at the
good man for having used some of the <i>Ovid</i> cuts as
a basis to his illuminations in this gigantic work.</p>

<p>After 1496 to the end of the century, Vérard's
dated books are very few. The only one I have
met with myself is a <i>Merlin</i> of 1498. It is possible
that he produced less (the <i>Miroir</i> may not have
proved a financial success), but it is quite as likely
that he merely discontinued his wholesome practice
of dating his books, and that the <i>Boethius</i>, the
<i>Roman de la Rose</i>, the <i>Gestes Romaines</i>, the romances
of <i>Tristram</i> and <i>Gyron</i>, and other undated works,
whose colophons show that they were printed while
the Pont Notre Dame was still standing, <i>i.e.</i> before
October 25th, 1499, belong to these years. After
1500 Vérard's enterprise certainly seems less. He
continued to issue editions of poets and romances,
but they are much less sumptuous than of yore,<!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and in place of his great folios we have a series of
small octavos, mostly of works of devotion, with
no other ornament than the strange twists of the
initial L, which adorns their title-pages. The
example here given is from an undated and unsigned
edition of the <i>Livre du Faulcon</i>, but the
letter itself frequently occurs in Vérard's undoubted
books. The first hint for this grotesque form of ornament
may have been found in the small initials
of Du Pré's 1486 edition of S. Jerome's <i>Vie des
anciens saintz Pères</i>, and variants of the L were
used by other publishers besides Vérard, <i>e.g.</i> by
Jacques Maillet at Lyons, and Pierre Le Rouge and
Michel Le Noir at Paris. The most noticeable
examples of the L, besides the one here given, are
the man-at-arms L of the 1488 edition of the <i>Mer
des Histoires</i> (P. Lerouge), the monkey-and-bagpipes
L, here shown, from Maillet's 1494 edition of the
<i>Recueil des Histoires Troyennes</i>, a St. George-and-the-Dragon
L in a Lyons reprint of the <i>Mer des
Histoires</i>, and the January-and-May L which, I
believe, was first used by Vérard for a 1492 edition
of the <i>Matheolus</i>, or 'quinze joies du mariage,' but
of which a counterpart existed at Lyons.</p>

<p>It seems probable that the attention which Vérard
paid to his vellum editions, in which the woodcuts
were only useful as guides to the illustrator, made
him less careful than he would otherwise have been
to secure the best possible work in his ordinary
books. Certainly I think his most interesting cuts<!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
are to be found not in his later books but in the
collection of six treatises which he had printed by
Gillet Cousteau and Jehan Menard in 1492, and
republished, somewhat less sumptuously, the next
year, under the collective title <i>L'art de bien vivre et
de bien mourir</i>, the reprint coming from the press
of Pierre Le Rouge. The cuts in this collection
have a special interest for us, because some of them
were afterwards used in English books, and we may
therefore be allowed to examine them at some
length.</p>

<span class="caption">From Vérard&#39;s <i>Art de bien vivre</i>. (Reduced.)</span>
</div>

<p>In the 1492 edition the first title-page <i>Le liure
intitule lart de bien mourir</i> heralds only the first
work, an adaptation of the old <i>Ars Moriendi</i> showing
the struggle between good and bad angels for
the possession of the dying soul. The devils tempt
the sufferer to hasten his end ('interficias teipsum'
one of them is saying, the words being printed on a
label), they remind him of his sins ('periuratus es'),
tempt him to worldly thoughts ('intende thesauro'),
persuade his physicians to over-commiseration
('Ecce quantam penam patitur'), or flatter him
with undeserved praise ('coronam meruisti'). To
each of these assaults his good angels have a 'bonne
inspiracion' by way of answer, and the devils have
to confess 'spes nobis nulla' and to see the little
figure of the soul received into heaven. The second
treatise is called at the beginning <i>L'eguyllon de
crainte divine pour bien mourir</i>, but on the title-page
placed on the back of the last leaf 'les paines<!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
denfer et les paines de purgatoire.' Its illustrations
consist of large cuts in which devils are inflicting
excruciating and revolting tortures on their victims.
Its colophon gives the printers' names and the date
July 18, 1492. The next three parts of the book
are <i>Le Traité de l'avenement de l'Antechrist, Les
Quinze Signes</i>, or Fifteen Tokens of Judgment, and
<i>Les Joies du Paradis</i>. The printing of these was
finished on October 28. Only the middle treatise
is much illustrated, but here the artist had full play
for his powers in representing the fish swimming
on the hills, the seas falling into the abyss, the sea-monsters
covering the earth, the flames of the sea,
the trees wet with blood, the crumbling of cities,
the stones fighting among themselves, and the other<!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
signs of the Last Day. Perhaps the best of this set
of cuts is that representing the 'esbahissement'
or astonishment of the men and women who had
hidden themselves in holes in the earth, when at
last they ventured forth. But in the last treatise,
the <i>Art de bien vivre</i>, quaintness and horror are
replaced by really beautiful work. The cuts here
are intended to illustrate the Ave Maria, Lord's
Prayer, Creed, Ten Commandments, and Seven
Sacraments. Those in the last series are the largest
in the book, each of them occupying a full page.
The Creed has a series of smaller cuts of inferior
work. But the picture which precedes this, representing
the twelve apostles, and the pictures of
the Angelic Salutation, of the Pope invoking the
Blessed Virgin (here shown), and of Christ teaching
the Apostles, show the finest work, outside the
<i>Horae</i>, in any French books during the fifteenth
century. These blocks appear also in two English
books printed at Paris, in 1503, <i>The Traytte of god
lyuyng and good deyng</i>, and <i>The Kalendayr of Shyppars</i>,
and in many of the English editions of the
latter work from Pynson's in 1506 onward.</p>

<p>Pierre Lerouge, one of Vérard's printers, produced
at least one fine book quite independently of him.
This is the first illustrated edition of <i>La Mer des
Hystoires</i>, the French version of the <i>Rudimentum
Noviciorum</i> (see p. 50), the general plan of which
it follows, though not slavishly. Pierre Lerouge
printed his edition for a publisher named Vincent<!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span><!-- Page 159 --><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>
Commin. It is in two tall folios, with the man-at-arms
L to decorate its title-pages, and splendid
initials P, I, and S, the first having within it a figure
of a scribe at work, the S being twisted into the form
of a scaly snake, and the body of the I containing
a figure of Christ. The cuts and borders of the book
are not very remarkable. In 1498 Vérard published
a new edition of it, having obtained the use of
the old blocks. A Lyons reprint was issued about
1500, and other editions during the sixteenth
century. Two other printers who cannot be said
to have learnt anything from Vérard are Jean
Bonhomme, who as early as 1486 printed an illustrated
edition of a very popular book, <i>Le livre des
profits champêtres</i>, translated from the Latin of
Petrus Crescentius, and Germain Bineaut, who in
1490 printed a <i>Pathelin le grant et le petit</i> which is
said to have woodcuts. Guyot Marchant's series of
editions of the <i>Danse Macabre</i> or 'danse des Morts,'
has been already mentioned. An edition of the same
work, printed at Lyons, February 18, 1499 (no
printer's name), a copy of which is among the books
which entered the British Museum under the bequest
of Mr. Alfred Huth, is especially interesting as containing
cuts of the shops of a printer and a bookseller,
at both of which Death is at work.</p>

<span class="caption">From a Lyons <i>Danse Macabre</i>, 1499. (Much reduced.)</span>
</div>

<p>Another edition of the <i>Danse</i> was printed by
Nicole de la Barre at Paris in 1500, and others of
the same character in the early years of the next
century. We shall have to recur to the book again<!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
both with reference to the <i>Horae</i> and for the later
Lyons editions, the cuts in which followed designs
by Holbein.</p>

<p>The only other Paris printer whom we have space
here to mention is Jean Trepperel, whose career
began in 1492, in which year, according to Hain, he
issued a <i>Histoire de Pierre de Provence et de la belle
Maguelonne</i>, probably illustrated. In 1493 he published
an edition of the <i>Chroniques de France</i>, with
four cuts, one of the founding of a town, another
of an assault, and two battle scenes. They are
good of their kind, especially that which serves for
all the founders of cities from Æneas and Romulus
to S. Louis, but their repetition becomes a little
wearisome. In an undated issue of Jehan Quentin's
<i>Orologe de Devotion</i> the cuts are all different, but
fall into two series, one badly drawn and infamously
engraved, the other showing really fine work, and
having all the appearance of having been originally
designed for a Book of Hours.</p>

<p>The only other fifteenth century book of Trepperel's
with which I am acquainted is a charming quarto
edition of the romance of <i>Paris et Vienne</i>, a copy of
which is in the Morgan collection. It is undated,
but was printed while the Pont Notre Dame was
still standing. The title-cut shows signs of breakage,
and may possibly have been designed for the earlier
edition by Denis Meslier mentioned by Brunet as
having a single cut. The rest of the large cuts in
the book have all the appearance of having been<!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
specially designed for the new edition, and are
equal to the best work in the <i>Horae</i>. Meanwhile
at Lyons the rude cuts of the books which heralded
illustrated work in France had been replaced by far
more artistic productions. In 1488 Michelet Topie
de Pymont and Jacques Herrnberg produced a
French version (by Nicole Le Huen) of Breydenbach's
<i>Peregrinatio</i> (see p. 57) with copies of some
of the original cuts, the smaller ones cut on wood,
the large maps engraved on copper. The next year
Jacques Maillet brought out a rival version (by
Frere Jehan de Hersin) for which he acquired the
original Mainz woodblocks themselves. To Maillet,
also, we owe passable imitations of some of the
less sumptuous books of Vérard's. Lastly, Jean
Trechsel struck out a new line in a profusely illustrated
<i>Terence</i> of 1493. At Rouen the Missal and
Breviary printed by Martin Morin were adorned with
a curious initial M and B in the same style as some
of the more frequent Ls, and Pierre Regnault did
work which Vérard found worthy of his vellum.
Paris, however, having once gained the predominance
in illustrated work, had as yet no difficulty in maintaining
her position.</p>

<p>It remains for us to notice briefly the printers'
devices in early French books. These are so numerous
that it is possible to divide them into rough
classes. The largest of these is formed by the marks
which have as their central ornament a tree with a
shield or label hung on the trunk, with supporters<!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
varied according to the owner's fancy, and which
are not always easy to assign to their right place
in the animal creation. Durand Gerlier preferred
rams, Michel Tholoze wild men, Denys Janot a
creature which looks like a kangaroo, Hemon Le
Fevre dancing bears duly muzzled and chained,
Simon Vostre leopards, Thielmann Kerver unicorns,
Felix Baligault rabbits, Robert Gourmont winged
stags, Jehan Guyart of Bordeaux dolphins. Most
of these devices have a dotted background, and they
are sometimes found printed in red ink, which adds
greatly to their decorative effect. Another class,
to which Vérard's well-known device belongs,
showed in their upper part the French lilies crowned
and supported by angels. Jean Le Forestier combined
this with the tree of knowledge, choosing lions
as its supporters, but adding also the sacred lamb
(for his name 'Jean'), and similar variations were
adopted by other printers. In another large class
the French printers, especially those of Lyons, followed
the simple cross and circle so common in
Italy. This was mostly printed in white on a
black ground, as by Pierre Levet, Matthieu Vivian
of Orleans, and Le Tailleur. Less often, as in the
marks of Berthold Rembolt and Georges Wolf, the
ground is white and the design black. Guillaume
Balsarin who, as was very common, had two devices,
had one of each kind. Outside these classes
the special designs are too many to be enumerated.
The successive Le Noirs punned on their names in<!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
at least six different devices of black heads, and
Deny de Harsy with less obvious appropriateness
selected two black men with white waistbands to
uphold his shields. Guyot Marchant's shoemakers,
with the bar of music to complete his pious motto
<i>Sola fides sufficit</i>, form one of the earliest and best
known of French marks. Pierre Regnault showed
excellent taste in his flower-surrounded P, in which
the letters of his surname may also be deciphered.
The scholar-printer Badius Ascensius chose a useful,
if not very pretty, design of printers at work, the
two variants of which first appear respectively in
1507 and 1521. All these devices and countless
others will be found roughly figured in Silvestre's
<i>Marques Typographiques</i>, many of them appear
also in Brunet's <i>Manuel du Libraire</i>, and those of
the chief fifteenth century printers have been
reproduced with absolute fidelity in M. Thierry-Poux's
<i>Monuments de l'imprimerie française</i>. Only
the mark of Du Pré and one of those used by
Caillaut are therefore given here, the first (on
p. <a href="#Page_141">141</a>) in honour of a pioneer in French illustration,
the second, as perhaps the most beautiful of
any which the present writer has seen.<!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p>The first Greek book printed in France appeared
in 1507, and the awakening of classical feeling was
accompanied, as in other countries, by the putting
away of the last remnants of mediæval art and
literature as childish things. The old romances<!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
continued to be published, chiefly by the Lenoirs,
but in a smaller and cheaper form, and for the most
part with old cuts. Vérard diminished his output,
and the publishers of the <i>Horae</i> turned in despair
to German designs in place of the now despised
native work. Soon only some little octavos remained
to show that there was still an unclassical
public to be catered for. These were chiefly
printed by Galliot du Pré, with titles in red and
black, and sometimes with little architectural
borders in imitation of the more ambitious German
ones. When they disappear we say farewell to
the richness and colour which distinguishes the best
French books of the end of the fifteenth century.
Instead of the black letter and quaint cuts we have
graceful but cold Roman types, or pretty but thin
italics, with good initial letters, sometimes with good
head-and tail-pieces, but with few pictures, and with
only a neat allegoric device on the title-page instead
of the rich designs used by the earlier printers.</p>

<p>Geoffroy Tory of Bourges was the first important
printer of the new school. His earliest connection
with publishing was as the editor of various classical
works, but he returned from a visit to Italy full of
artistic theories as to book-making, which he proceeded
to carry out, partly in alliance with Simon
Colines, for whom he designed a new device representing
Time with his scythe. Tory's own
device of the 'pot cassé,' a broken vase pierced by
a <i>toret</i> or auger, is said to refer to his desolation on<!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the death of his only daughter. Devices of other
printers have been ascribed to him on the ground
of the appearance in them of the little cross of
Lorraine, which is found in some of Tory's undoubted
works. It is certain, however, that the
cross was not his individual signature, but only
that of his studio.</p>

<p>After the <i>Horae</i>, which we shall notice in our next
chapter, Tory's most famous book was his own
<i>Champfleury</i>, 'auquel est contenu l'art et science
de la vraie proportion des lettres antiques,' printed
in 1529. This is a fantastic work, interesting for
the prelude in which he speaks of his connection
with the famous Grolier, and for the few illustrations
scattered about the text. The best of these are the
vignettes of 'Hercules Gallicus,' leading in chains
the captives of his eloquence, and of the Triumphs
of Apollo and the Muses. The specimen alphabets
at the end of the book also deserve notice. They
show that Tory was better than his theories, for
his attempt to prove, by far-fetched analogies and
derivations, that there is an ideal shape for every
letter, is as bad in art as it is false in history.</p>

<p>Tory was succeeded in his office of royal printer
by Robert Estienne, and during the rest of the
century the classical editions of this family of great
printers form the chief glories of the French press.
Their books, both large and small, are admirably
printed, and in excellent taste, though with no
other ornaments than their printer's device, and<!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
good initials and head-pieces. But it must be
owned that from the reign of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> onwards,
the decoration of the text of most French books
is far less interesting than the superb bindings on
which the kings and their favourites began to lavish
so much expense.</p>

<p>Only two more Paris books need here be mentioned,
both of them printed in 1546, and both with
cuts imitated from the Italian&mdash;Jacques Gohary's
translation of the <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i> and the
<i>Amour de Cupido et de Psiché</i> translated from
Apuleius. The first of these was published by
Jacques Kerver, the second by Jeanne de Marnef.
Of original Paris work of any eminence we have no
record after the death of Tory.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at Lyons a new school of book-illustration
was springing up. From the beginning
of the century the Lyons printers had imitated, or
pirated, the delicate italic books printed by Aldus.
The luckless Étienne Dolet added something to the
classical reputation of the town, and by the middle
of the century the printers there were turning out
numerous pocket editions of the classics, which they
sold to their customers in 'trade bindings' of calf
stamped with gold, and often painted over with
many-coloured interlacements. The fashion for
small books was set, and when illustrations were
fitted to them the result was singularly dainty.</p>

<p>Before considering the editions of Jean de Tournes
and his rivals we must stop to notice the appear<!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>ance
at Lyons in 1538 of the belated first edition
of Holbein's <i>Dance of Death</i>, the woodcuts for
which, the work of H. L., whose identity with
Hans Lützelburger has been sufficiently established,
are known to have been in existence as early as
1527, and were probably executed two or three
years before that date. Several sets of proofs
from the woodcuts are in existence, with lettering
said to be in the types of Froben of Basel, who
may have abandoned the idea of publishing them
because of the vigour of their satire on the nobles
and well-to-do. The Trechsels, the printers of the
French edition, are known to have had dealings
with a Basel woodcutter with initials H. L., who
died before June 1526, and may have purchased
the blocks directly from him, or at a later date
from Froben. In 1538 they issued forty-one woodcuts
with a dedication by Jean de Vauzelles, and a
French quatrain to each cut either by him or by
Gilles Corrozet, giving to the book the title <i>Les
Simulachres et historiees faces de la mort</i>. Its success
was as great as it deserved, and ten more cuts were
added in subsequent editions.</p>

<p>In the same year as the <i>Dance of Death</i> the Trechsels
issued another series of upwards of a hundred
cuts after designs by Holbein, the <i>Historiarum
Veteris Testamenti Icones</i>, with explanatory verses
by Gilles Corrozet. These, though scarcely less beautiful,
and at the time almost as successful as those
in the <i>Dance of Death</i>, are not quite so well known,<!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and I therefore select one of them, taken from the
reprint of the following year, as an illustration.</p>

<span class="caption">From <i>Historiarum Veteris Testamenti Icones</i>, Lyons, 1539.</span>
</div>

<p>The success of these two books invited imitation,
and during the next twenty years many dainty
illustrated books were issued by Franciscus Gryphius,
Macé Bonhomme, Guillaume Roville, and Jean
de Tournes. In 1540 Gryphius issued a little Latin
Testament, with thirty-four lines of dainty Roman
type to a page, which only measures 3&frac12; in. × 2, and
in which are set charming cuts. Bonhomme's chief
success was an edition, printed in 1556, of the first
three books of the <i>Metamorphoses</i> translated into
French verse by Clément Marot and Barthélemy
Aneau. This has borders to every page, and
numerous vignettes measuring only 1&frac12; in. × 2. In
the following year this was capped by Jean de
Tournes with another version of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>,
with borders and vignettes attributed to Bernard
Salomon, usually called 'le petit Bernard,' and the
success of the book caused it to be re-issued in Dutch
and Italian. The borders are wonderfully varied,
some of them containing little grotesque figures
worthy of our own Doyle, others dainty lacework,
and others less pleasing architectural essays. This,
like most of the best books of its kind, was printed
throughout in italics, and the attempt about this
time of Robert Granjon, another Lyons printer,
to supersede the italic by a type modelled on the
French cursive hand, the 'caractères de civilité,'
was only partially successful. In 1563, and possibly<!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span><!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
in other years, Jean de Tournes published an
almanack and engagement-book, a <i>Calendrier historial</i>,
with tiny vignettes representing the occupations
appropriate to the seasons, and alternate
pages for the entry of notes by any purchasers
barbarous enough to deface so charming a book
with their hasty handwriting. When the brief blaze
of pretty books at Lyons died out, French printing
fast sinks into dulness, and the attempt of a Frenchman
at Antwerp to revive its glories was only
partially successful, though he has left behind him a
great name. Jean Plantin was born at Tours in
1514, and after trying to earn a living first at Paris
and then at Caen, set up a bookseller's shop at
Antwerp in 1549, and six years later printed his
first book, the <i>Institution d'une fille de noble maison</i>.
He was soon in a position to give commissions to
good artists, Luc de Heere, Pierre Huys, Godefroid
Ballain, and others, and issued the <i>Devises Héroiques</i>
of Claude Paradin (1562), and the <i>Emblems</i> of
Sambucus (1564), of Hadrianus Junius (1565), and
Alciati (1566), with illustrations from their designs.
His <i>Horae</i>, printed in 1566 and 1575, with florid
borders, and his <i>Psalter</i> of 1571, attempted to revive
a class of book then going out of fashion. Besides
the great Antwerp Polyglott, whose printing occupied
him from 1568 to 1573, and nearly brought
him to ruin, Plantin printed some other Bibles, one
in Flemish in 1566, and a 'Bible royale' in 1570,
being noticeable for their ambitious decoration.<!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
He published also some great folio missals, more
imposing than elegant. He had numerous sets of
large initials, one specially designed for music books
being really graceful, and a long array of variations
on the device of the hand and compass which he
adopted as his mark. The title-pages of his larger
books are surrounded with heavy architectural
borders, some of which were engraved on copper.
At his death, in 1589, he had attained <i>labore et
constantia</i>, as his motto phrased it, to a foremost
position among the printers of his day, but his florid
illustrated books have very little real beauty, and
mark the beginning of a century and a half of bad
taste from which only the microscopic editions of
the Elzevirs are wholly free.</p>

while some of the old cuts were retained this Du Guesclin was
replaced by a much more showy figure.</p></div>

<h3>THE FRENCH BOOKS OF HOURS</h3>


<p>In the course of the fourteenth century the Hours
of the Blessed Virgin superseded the Psalter as
the popular book of devotions for lay use. Throughout
the fifteenth century magnificently illuminated
manuscript copies were produced in France in great
numbers, and it is thus not surprising that it was
in illustrated editions of this book that French
printers and publishers achieved their most noteworthy
success.</p>

<p>Each of the Hours, we are told, had its mystical
reference to some event in the lives of the Blessed
Virgin and our Lord. Lauds referred to the visit
of Mary to Elizabeth, Prime to the Nativity, Terce
to the Angels' Message to the Shepherds, Sext to
the Adoration by the Magi, Nones to the Circumcision,
Vespers to the Flight into Egypt, Compline
to the Assumption of the Virgin. The subsidiary
Hours of the Passion naturally suggested the
Crucifixion or, less frequently, the Invention or
finding of the Cross by the Emperor Constantine,
and those of the Holy Spirit the Day of Pentecost.
We have here the subjects for nine pictures, which
were almost invariably heralded by one of the
Annunciation, and might easily be increased by a<!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
representation of the Adoration by the Shepherds,
of the Murder of the Innocents, and the Death of
the Virgin. Moreover, the contents of Books of
Hours were gradually enlarged till they deserved
the title, which has been given them, of the Lay-Folk's
Prayer-Book. A typical Book of Hours
would contain&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>(i.) A Kalendar (one picture).</p>

<p>(ii.) Passages from the Gospels on the Passion of
Christ. (One to three pictures.)</p>

<p>(iii.) Private Prayers.</p>

<p>(iv.) The Hours themselves&mdash;Horae intemeratae
beatae Mariae Virginis&mdash;with the subsidiary
Hours of the Passion and of the
Holy Ghost. (Nine to thirteen pictures.)</p>

<p>(v.) The Seven Penitential Psalms. (One or two
pictures.)</p>

<p>(vi.) The Litany of the Saints.</p>

<p>(vii.) The Vigils of the Dead. (One to four pictures.)</p>

<p>(viii.) Seven Psalms on Christ's Passion.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Kalendar usually contained poetical directions
for the preservation of health, and was therefore
preluded by a rather ghastly anatomical
picture of a man. The passages from the Gospel,
which began with the first chapter of S. John, were
illustrated by a picture of the evangelist's martyrdom,
and the Passion by one of the Kiss of Judas,
or of the Crucifixion. To the Penitential Psalms
were sometimes prefixed pictures of Bathsheba<!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
bathing on her housetop, and of the death of Uriah,
or, more rarely, of an angel appearing to David
with weapons in his hand, signifying the three
punishments between which he must choose for his
sin in numbering the people. The Litany of the
Saints offered too wide a field for full-page cuts to
be assigned it, but was often illustrated by smaller
ones set in the text. To the Vigils of the Dead the
commonest illustrations at first were those of 'Les
Trois Vifs et Les Trois Morts,' three gay cavaliers
meeting their own grinning corpses. 'Dives and
Lazarus' was first joined with these and afterwards
superseded them. We also find pictures of the
Day of Judgment, the Entombment, and in one
instance of a funeral. Two illustrations in honour
of the Eucharist are also of common occurrence&mdash;one
of angels upholding a chalice,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the other of the
Vision of S. Gregory, when he saw the crucified
Christ appearing on the altar. If we add to these
a picture of the Tree of Jesse, and another of the
Church in heaven and on earth, we shall have exhausted
the list of subjects which appear with any
frequency, though pictures of the Creation and
Fall, of David and Goliath, of the Descent from the
Cross, and perhaps one or two others may occasionally
be found. It should be mentioned that the<!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
illustrations to the Psalms on the Passion are
usually repeated from others previously used, but
putting these on one side, it will be found that we
have accounted for the subjects of some five-and-twenty
pictures, and this is in excess of the number
found in any one book, which varies from six to
twenty-two.</p>

<p>In some of the earlier <i>Horae</i>, as we shall see, the
printers contented themselves with these large illustrations,
and in others surrounded the text with
purely decorative borders of flowers and birds. But
in a typical edition the borders consist of a number
of small blocks or plates, the figures in which reinforced
the teaching of the main illustrations. In
an edition printed by Jean Du Pré in February
1488-9, five pages are devoted to an explanation
of these vignettes, and it will not be a waste of
space to quote a few lines:</p>

<blockquote><p>¶Cest le repertoire des histoires &amp; figures de la bible tant du
vieilz testame<i>n</i>t q<i>ue</i> du nouueau <i>con</i>tenues dedens les vignettes
de ces presentes heures imprimees en cuyure. En
chascune desq<i>ue</i>lles vignettes so<i>n</i>t contenues deux figures
du vieilz testame<i>n</i>t signifia<i>n</i>s une vraye histoire du nouueau.
Co<i>m</i>me il appert par les chapitres cottez et alleguez au
propos tant en latin que fra<i>n</i>coys en chascune desd<i>its</i> figures

tho. vi.</p></blockquote><p><!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we see that, as first planned, the border
vignettes formed a continuous series illustrating
historically the teaching of the <i>Horae</i> by reference
to Old Testament types, with chapter and verse
for their significance. It will be noticed also that
it is distinctly stated that the vignettes in this edition
were 'imprimées en cuyvre,' printed on copper.
Two months later, in an edition published by
Antoine Vérard (April 5, 1489), the same table
was reproduced with very slight alterations. The
words 'en cuyvre' were then omitted, but 'imprimées'
was left in, awkwardly enough. There can
be no doubt that the omission was deliberate, and
we have thus two statements which reinforce the
opinion of the best experts, that both wood and
copper were employed in engraving different editions
of these designs.</p>

<p>These Old Testament types do not appear to have
long retained their popularity, and were soon superseded
by a less continuous form of illustration. The
Calendar offered an excuse for introducing one series
of vignettes of the sports and occupations of each
month, another of the signs of the zodiac, and a
third giving pictures of the saints in connection
with the days on which they were commemorated.
The Gospels of the Passion were illustrated by
vignettes on the same subject; the Hours themselves
by a long series on the lives of Christ and
of the Blessed Virgin. The Dance of Death was
brought in to illustrate the Vigils of the Dead, and<!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
relief was given by some charming scenes of hunting
and rural life, which formed the border to the
Private Prayers and the Litany of the Saints. In
addition to these, we have representations of the
Prophets and Sibyls, of the Cardinal Virtues, and
the Lives of the Saints, and an admixture of purely
decorative or grotesque designs. Between the vignettes
spaces were often left, which were filled in,
sometimes with illustrative texts, sometimes with a
continuous prayer or exhortation, either in French
or Latin. Thus in the preliminary leaves of some of
the <i>Horae</i> the text read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Tout bon loyal et vaillant catholique qui commencer aucune
euure ymagine doit inuoquer en toute sa pratique premierement
la puissance diuine par ce beau nom iesus qui illumine
tout cueur humain &amp; tout entendement. Cest en
tout fait ung beau commencement:</p></blockquote>

<p>and when we turn to the Gospels of the Passion
we find a prayer beginning 'Protecteur des bons
catholiques donne nous croire tellement les paroles
euangeliques,' &amp;c. In Vérard's earlier editions the
book would have to be turned round to read the
words on the lower border, but in Pigouchet's this
defect was remedied, so that we are left free to
imagine that the prayer was meant for devotional
use, and not merely as a decoration.</p>

<p>The chief firms employed in the production of
these beautiful prayer-books during the fifteenth
century were (i.) Jean du Pré; (ii.) Antoine Vérard;
(iii.) Philippe Pigouchet, working chiefly for Simon<!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Vostre, a publisher, but also for De Marnef, Laurens
Philippe, and occasionally on his own account;
(iv.) Thielman Kerver. The proportion of dated
and undated editions is about equal, and with careful
study it ought to be possible to trace the career
of each of the important firms, noting when each
new illustration or vignette makes its first appearance.
Unfortunately great confusion has been introduced
into the bibliography of <i>Horae</i> by the
presence in them of calendars, mostly for twenty
years, giving the dates of the moveable feasts. All
that these calendars show is that the edition in
which they occur must have been printed before,
probably at least five or six years before, the last
year for which they are reckoned. The fact that,
<i>e.g.</i>, the editions printed by Pigouchet in August
and September 1498 have the 1488 to 1508 calendar
is by itself sufficient to prove that they cannot do
more than this. Unluckily a connection has often
been assumed between the first year of the calendar
and the year of publication&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> undated <i>Horae</i>
with the calendar for 1488-1508 are frequently
ascribed on that ground only to 1488, or with perverse
ingenuity to 1487; as if a calendar of the
moveable feasts were like an annual almanac, and
must necessarily be printed in readiness for the
new year. Great confusion has thus been caused,
so that it is impossible to trust any conjectural
date for an <i>Horae</i> unless we know the grounds on
which it is based.<!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest dated French <i>Horae</i> was finished by
Antoine Vérard on August 21, 1486, and followed
by another the next year dated July 7, 1487;
but the cuts in both of these are small and rude,
mere guides to an illuminator, and as Vérard's
later editions bring him into connection with other
publishers, it will be convenient to consider first
three editions by Jean Du Pré, all of which are of
great interest. The one which we must rank as
the earliest is an undated <i>Hore ad vsum Romanum</i>,
signed 'Jo. de Prato' (<i>i.e.</i> J. Du Pré) which can be
shown to have been issued some little time before
Feb. 19, 1488-9, the date of a Psalter printed by
Antoine Cayllaut in which one of the cuts appears
in a more worn condition. The text measures
4&frac12; in. by 3&frac14;. This is the only one of the three
which was known to Brunet, whose list of <i>Horae</i>
in the fifth volume of his <i>Manuel du Libraire</i>, long
as it is, is very incomplete. Its text, including the
borders, measures 5-5/8 in. by 3-5/8, and in addition to
Du Pré's mark and the anatomical man is illustrated
by nineteen engravings. Nine of these are the usual
illustrations to the Hours themselves, and the subsidiary
Hours of the Passion and of the Holy Ghost.
The Penitential Psalms are illustrated by David's
Bathsheba and the Death of Uriah, and the Vigils
of the Dead by a figure of Death. In addition to
these we have the Fall of Lucifer, Descent from
the Cross, with emblems of the four evangelists, a
figure of the Trinity, the Virgin and Child in glory,<!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
S. Christopher, S. Mary Magdalen, and the Vision of
S. Gregory, with small pictures from the life of
Christ and figures of the Saints. The borders
carry out the plan of the table of vignettes, containing
three scenes from the Bible and three heads,
with explanatory text, on each page throughout
the greater part of the book. Towards the end
these are replaced by figures of saints and angels.
The artist's designs have been rather spoilt by the
engraver, whose strokes are frequently much too
black.</p>

<p>The second of Du Pré's editions is a very interesting
book, for the illustrations are printed in three
colours&mdash;blue, red, and green. It is dated 1490, but
without the mention of any month. It has some
unusual illustrations&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> the three Maries with the
body of Christ, David and Goliath, Lazarus in
Abraham's bosom and Dives in torment, and S.
Christopher. Many of the pages are without vignettes,
and where these occur they are not joined
neatly together to form a continuous border, but set,
rather at haphazard, about the margin. Pictures
and vignettes are printed sometimes in the same,
sometimes in different colours. The page of text
measures 5&frac12; in. by 4, or without borders, 4 by 2&frac12;.</p>

<p>The last edition known to me by Du Pré is undated,
and has a Latin title-page, <i>Hore ad usum
Romanum. Jo. de Prato.</i> The text with borders
measures 4&frac12; in. by 3&frac12;. Its borders are similar to
those of the large folios of the period, having a floral<!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
groundwork, into which birds, figures of men and
women, angels and grotesques are introduced. To
make up for the lack of vignettes there are seven
small illustrations of the Passion set in the text.
For the larger illustrations, which appear to be
woodcuts, Du Pré again varied his subjects, introducing
for the only time in these three editions <i>Les
Trois Vifs et Les Trois Morts</i>, reduced reproductions
of which are here given.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that so enterprising
a publisher as Vérard would rest content with the
very unpretentious <i>Horae</i> he produced in 1486 and
1487, but the precise date at which he first made a
more ambitious essay is not easy to fix. The undated
edition of his <i>Grandes Heures</i> for the use of
Rome is constantly assigned to 1488, for no other
reason than that it contains the 1488-1508 Almanac,
though the breaks in the borders suffice to show
that this was not the first appearance of the blocks.
At the library at Toulouse there is said to be a
Vérard <i>Horae ad usum Romanum</i> dated April 3,
1488, that is, as the French year at this time began,
at Easter, 1489, and this may be the first of Vérard's
new editions. This was followed the next year by
the first edition of his <i>Grandes Heures</i>, with thirteen
woodcuts and a frontispiece. I have not been fortunate
enough to see a copy of either of these editions,
but three undated <i>Horae</i> in the British Museum,
printed by Vérard, seem to belong to the same type
as the <i>Grandes Heures</i>. In addition to a poorly cut<!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Vision of Heaven, the Anatomical Man, and the
Chalice, they contain, in varying order, fourteen
large woodcuts&mdash;(i.) The Fall of Lucifer; (ii.) the
history of Adam and Eve; (iii.) a double picture,
the upper half showing the strife between Mercy,
Justice, Peace, and Reason in the presence of God,
and the lower half the Annunciation, which followed
the triumph of Mercy; (iv.) the Marriage of Joseph
and Mary; (v.) the Invention of the Cross; (vi.)<!-- Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the Gift of the Spirit; (vii.) a double picture of the
Nativity and the Adoration by the Shepherds;
(viii.) the Adoration by the Magi; (ix.) a double
picture of the Annunciation to the Shepherds and
of peasants dancing round a tree; (x.) the Circumcision;
(xi.) the Killing of the Innocents;
(xii.) the Crowning of the Virgin; (xiii.) David
entering a castle, with the words 'Tibi soli peccavi,'&mdash;against
Thee only have I sinned,&mdash;issuing from<!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
his mouth; (xiv.) a funeral service, the hearse
standing before the altar. The cut of the Message
to the Shepherds here shown will give a fair idea of
the characteristics of this series, as well as of the
borders by which they were accompanied.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> A full
list of the larger subjects has been given because
some of them often occur in later editions joined
with other pictures of the school of Pigouchet, and
it is useful to be able to fix their origin at a glance.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Six of them form the only large illustrations in the
little <i>Horae</i>, printed for Vérard, April 5, 1489, in
which, as we have already noted, the words 'on
copper' appear to have been deliberately omitted
from the table of the vignettes. The size of the
<i>Grandes Heures</i> is 8 in. by 5, that of the edition of
April 1489, 6 in. by 4. Brunet enumerates altogether
thirty editions of <i>Horae</i> printed by Vérard, the last
of which bearing a date belongs to the year 1510.
So far as I am acquainted with them these later
editions have few distinguishing characteristics,
but are mostly made up with illustrations designed
for other firms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 262px;">

<span class="caption">From a <i>Grandes Heures</i> of Antoine Vérard.</span>
</div>

<p>We come now to the most celebrated of all the
series of <i>Horae</i>, those printed by Pigouchet, chiefly
for Simon Vostre. Brunet in his list rightly dis<!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span><!-- Page 187 --><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>credits
the existence of an edition by this printer
dated as early as January 5, 1486. He accepts,
however, and briefly describes as if he had himself
seen, one of September 16, 1488, and mentions
also an edition printed April 8, 1488-9. No copy
of either of these editions has come to light during
the twenty years in which the present writer has
been interested in <i>Horae</i>, and it seems fairly certain
that Pigouchet's first illustrated work is to
be found in an edition <i>Ad usum Parisiensem</i>, dated
December 1, 1491. The large cuts in this are fairly
good, but a little stiff; the small border-cuts
include a long set of incidents in the life of Christ
with Old Testament types after the manner of
the <i>Biblia Pauperum</i>. A <i>Horae</i> of May 8, 1492,
substitutes floral borders for these little pictures.
In another set of editions in which Pigouchet was
concerned, apparently between 1493 and 1495, the
borders are made up of vignettes of very varying
size, which may be recognised by many of them
being marked with Gothic letters, mostly large
minuscules. Sometimes one, sometimes two, vignettes
thus lettered occur on a page, and we may
presume that the lettering, which is certainly a
disfigurement, was intended to facilitate the
arrangement of the borders. In these <i>Horae</i>, also,
the designs are comparatively coarse and poor.
Some of the large illustrations are divided into an
upper compartment, containing the main subject,
and two lower compartments, containing its 'types.'<!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 259px;">

</div><p><!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly by 1496, and possibly in earlier editions
which I have not seen, Pigouchet had arrived
at his typical style, of which a good specimen-page
is given in our illustration from the edition of August
22, 1498. His original idea appears to have been for
editions with a page of text measuring 5&frac12; in. by 3&frac12;,
such as he issued on April 17, 1496, and January 18,
1496-97. But at least as early as November 4,
1497, he added another inch both to the height and
breadth of his page by the insertion of the little
figures, which will be noticed at the left of the lower
corner and on the right at the top. The extra inch
was valuable, for it enabled him to surround his large
illustrations with vignettes, but the borders themselves
are not improved by them, for they mar the
rich effect of the best work in which the backgrounds
are of black with pricks of white.</p>

<p>These same dotted backgrounds, which we have
already noticed as present in some of the finest of
the printers' marks, appear also in three plates,
which are found in the 1498 editions, and thenceforward,
but, as far as I can ascertain, not earlier.
These three plates illustrate (i.) the Tree of Jesse;
(ii.) the Church Militant and Triumphant; (iii.) the
Adoration of the Shepherds. All three plates are of
great beauty, and the last is noticeable for the names&mdash;'Mahault,'
'Aloris,' 'Alison,' 'Gobin le Gay,' and
'le beau Roger'&mdash;which are assigned to the shepherds
and their wives, and which are the same as
those by which they are known in the French<!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
mystery-plays. The artists who used these dotted
backgrounds evidently viewed the <i>Horae</i> rather
from the mystery-play standpoint. They cared
little for the 'types' which Vérard and Du Pré so
carefully explained in their early editions, but delighted
in the Dance of Death and in scenes of
hunting and rural life, or failing these in grotesques.
They placed their talents at the disposal of religion,
but they bargained to be allowed to introduce a
good deal of humour as well.</p>

<p>The best French <i>Horae</i> were all published within
about ten years. During this decade, which just
overlaps the fifteenth century, the only serious rival
of Pigouchet was Thielman Kerver, who began
printing in 1497, and by dint of close imitation
approached very near indeed to Pigouchet's success.
With the lessening of Pigouchet's activity about
1505, there came an after-flood of bad taste, which
swept everything before it. The old French designs
were displaced by reproductions of German
work utterly unsuited to the French types and
ornaments, and along with these there came an
equally disastrous substitution of florid Renaissance
borders of pillars and cherubs for Pigouchet's charming
vignettes and hunting scenes. Thielman Kerver,
who had begun with better things, soon made his
surrender to the new fashion, and his firm continued
to print <i>Horae</i>, for which it is difficult to
find a good word until about 1556. His activity
was more than equalled by Gilles Hardouyn, who<!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
with his successors was responsible for some seventy
editions during the first half of the sixteenth
century. Guillaume Eustace, Guillaume Godard,
and François Regnault were less formidable competitors,
and besides these some thirty or forty
editions are attributable to other printers.</p>

<span class="caption">From Tory&#39;s <i>Horae</i>, 1525. (Reduced.)</span>
</div>

<p>On January 16th (or to use the affected style of
the colophon itself, 'xvii. Kal. Febr.'), 1525, Geoffroy
Tory, the scholar, artist, and printer, in conjunction
with his friend Simon Colines, brought out a <i>Horae</i>,
which is certainly not open to the charge of bad
taste. The printed page measures 6&frac14; in. by 3&frac34;,
the type used is a delicate Roman letter with a
slight employment of red ink, but no hand work,
the borders are in the most delicate style of the
Renaissance. The illustrations number twelve, of
which one, that of the Annunciation, occupies two
pages. There are no unusual subjects, except that
in the picture of the Crucifixion Tory displays
his classical pedantry by surrounding the central
picture with four vignettes illustrating Virgil's
'Sic vos non vobis' quatrain, on the sheep, the
bees, the birds, and the oxen, whose life enriches
others but not themselves. In the picture of the
Adoration by the Magi, here given, Tory obtains
an unusually rich effect by the figure of the negro.
He repeats this, on a smaller scale, in the black
raven, croaking <i>Cras, Cras</i>, in the picture of the
Triumph of Death. The tone of the other illustrations
is rather thin, and the length of the faces<!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span><!-- Page 193 --><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>
and slight angularity in the figures (effects which
Tory, the most affected of artists, no doubt deliberately
sought for) cause them just to fall short
of beauty. Compared, however, with the contemporary
editions of other printers, Tory's <i>Horae</i>
seem possessed of every beauty. We know of five
editions before his death or retirement in 1533,
and of some seven others before the close of the
half century. After 1550 the publication of <i>Horae</i>
in France almost entirely ceased, but some pretty
editions were issued at Antwerp by the French
printer Christopher Plantin in 1565 and 1575, and
perhaps in other years. The decree of Pope Pius <span class="smcap">V.</span>
making the use of the Office no longer obligatory on
the clergy seems to have been preceded by a great
falling off of the popularity of the Hours among the
laity, in whom the booksellers had found their
chief customers, and after 1568 a very few editions
sufficed to supply the demand of those who were
still wedded to their use.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>HOLLAND</h3>


<p>Thirty years ago, under the title <i>The Woodcutters
of the Netherlands</i> (a little suggestive of a story for
boys on life in a Dutch forest) Sir Martin Conway
wrote a treatise on the early book-illustrations of
the Low Countries, which is still the standard work
on the subject, and only needed plenty of facsimiles
to make it completely illuminating. Unfortunately
in 1884 the process block was still in its infancy,
and in the absence of this cheap method of reproduction
the book was issued without a single picture.
Written some nine years later the present chapter
epitomises so much of Sir Martin's treatise as the
rather scanty stock of Low Country illustrated
books in England enabled me to visualise, and for
lack of an intervening pilgrimage to Dutch libraries
comparatively little can now be added to it.</p>

<p>Sir Martin Conway divided his book into three
parts, the first giving the history of the woodcutters,
the second a catalogue of the cuts, and the third a
list of the books containing them. Putting on one
side the blocks imported or directly copied from
France and Germany, he attributes the illustrations
in fifteenth century Dutch books to some five-and-<!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>twenty
different workmen and their apprentices.
His first group is formed of&mdash;</p>

<p>(i.) A Louvain woodcutter who worked for John
and Conrad de Westphalia, for whom he cut two
capital little vignette portraits of themselves, and
for Veldener, for whom he executed the nine illustrations
in an edition of the <i>Fasciculus Temporum</i>,
published on December 29, 1475.</p>

<p>(ii.) A Utrecht woodcutter, whose most important
works are a set of cuts to illustrate the <i>Boeck des
gulden throens</i>, published by a mysterious printer,
Gl., in 1480, some additional cuts for a new edition
by Veldener of the <i>Fasciculus Temporum</i>, and a set
of thirty-nine cuts, chiefly on the life of Christ, for
the same printer's <i>Epistolen ende ewangelien</i> of
1481.</p>

<p>(iii.) A Bruges woodcutter, possibly the printer
himself, who illustrated Colard Mansion's French
edition of the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid (1484); and</p>

<p>(iv.) A Gouda woodcutter, by whose aid Gerard
Leeu started on his career as a printer of illustrated
books with the <i>Dialogus Creaturarum</i> (of which he
printed six editions between June 3, 1480, and
August 31, 1482), and the <i>Gesten van Romen</i>, <i>Vier
Uterste</i>, and <i>Historia Septem Sapientum</i>.</p>

<p>Of these books, whose illustrations are grouped
together as all executed in pure line work, the most
interesting to us are the <i>Metamorphoses</i> and the
<i>Dialogus</i>. The former is handsomely printed in
red and black in Mansion's large type, and has<!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
seventeen single-column cuts of gods and goddesses
and as many double-column ones illustrating the
Metamorphoses themselves. The larger cuts are
the more successful, and are certainly superior to
the average French work of the day, to which they
bear a considerable resemblance. Uncouth as they
are, they were thought good enough by Antoine
Vérard to serve as models for his own edition of
1493. The <i>Metamorphoses</i>, Mansion's first illustrated
book, was also the last work issued from his
press; and part of the edition was not published
till after his disappearance from Bruges. The
hundred and twenty-one cuts in Leeu's <i>Dialogus
Creaturarum</i> are the work of a far more inspired, if
very child-like, artist. With a minimum of strokes
the creatures about whom the text tells its wonderful
stories are drawn so as to be easily recognisable,
and we have no reason to suppose that the humour
which pervades them was otherwise than intentional.</p>

<p>We come now to the best period of Dutch
illustration, which centres round the presses of
Leeu at Gouda and Antwerp, and of Jacob Bellaert
at Haarlem, whose business was probably only
a branch of Leeu's. During his stay at Gouda,
Leeu commissioned an important set of sixty-eight
blocks, thirty-two of which were used in the <i>Lijden
ons Heeren</i> of 1482, and the whole set in a <i>Devote
Ghetiden</i>, which Sir Martin Conway conjectures to
have been published just after the printer's removal<!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to Antwerp in the summer of 1484. Fifty-two of
them were used again, in conjunction with other
cuts, in the <i>Boeck vanden leven Christi</i> of Ludolphus
in 1487, and the history of many of them can be
traced in other books to as late as 1510. Thus
they were evidently popular, though neither their
design nor their cutting calls for much praise.
Another set of seven cuts, to each of which is
joined a sidepiece showing a teacher and a scholar,
appears in Leeu's last Gouda book, the <i>Van den
Seven Sacramenten</i> of June 19, 1484, and evinces
a much greater mastery over his tools on the part
of the engraver. The little sidepiece, which was
added to bring the breadth of the cuts up to that
of Leeu's folio page (5&frac12; in.), is particularly good.</p>

<p>After Leeu's removal to Antwerp his activity as
a printer of illustrated books suffered a temporary
check, and our interest is transferred to the office
of Jacob Bellaert at Haarlem, who, after borrowing
some of Leeu's cuts for a <i>Lijden ons Heeren</i>, issued
in December 1483, in the following February had
printed under the name of <i>Der Sonderen troest</i> a
Dutch version of the <i>Belial</i> of Jacobus de Theramo.
This has altogether thirty-two cuts, the first of
which occupies a full page, and represents in its
different parts the fall of Lucifer and of Adam
and Eve, the Flood, the Passage of the Red Sea,
and the Baptism of Christ. Six half-page cuts represent
incidents of the Harrowing of Hell, the
Ascension, and the Day of Pentecost. The other<!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span><!-- Page 199 --><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>
illustrations at a hasty glance seem to be of the
same size (5 in. by 3&frac34;), but are soon discovered to
be separable into different blocks, usually three in
number. Eight blocks of 2&frac12; in. each, and seventeen
of half this width, are thus arranged in a series
of dramatic combinations. Thus we are first
shown the different persons who answer the citation
of Solomon, whose judgment hall is the central
block in thirteen illustrations; then the controversy
in heaven before Christ as the judge; then scenes
in a Royal Council Chamber, &amp;c. Our illustration
is taken from the opening of Solomon's Court, with
Belial appearing to plead on one side, and Christ
answering the summons of the messenger, Azahel,
on the other.</p>

<span class="caption">From Leeu&#39;s edition of <i>Der Sonderen troest</i>, Antwerp, 1484.</span>
</div>

<p>In October of the same year, 1484, Bellaert
printed an edition of the <i>Boeck des gulden throens</i>,
in which four cuts, representing the soul, depicted
as a woman with flowing hair, being instructed by
an elder, serve as illustrations to all the twenty-four
discourses. In 1485 we have first of all two
romances, the <i>Historie vanden vromen ridder Jason</i>
and the <i>Vergaderinge der Historien van Troyen</i>,
both translated from Raoul le Fèvre, and illustrated
with half-folio cuts, which I have not seen. At
the end of the year came a translation of Glanville's
<i>De Proprietatibus Rerum</i>, with eleven folio cuts, of
which the most interesting are the first, which
shows the Almighty seated in glory within a circle
thrown up by a black background, and the sixth,<!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
which contains twelve little medallions, representing
the pleasures and occupations of the different
months. During 1486 Bellaert printed three
illustrated books, an <i>Epistelen ende Euangelien</i>,
Pierre Michault's <i>Doctrinael des tyts</i>, an allegory,
in which Virtue exhibits to the author the schools
of Vice, and a Dutch version of Deguileville's
<i>Pélerinage de la vie humaine</i>. The ten cuts in the
second of these three books are described by Sir
Martin Conway as carefully drawn, the more
numerous illustrations in the others showing hasty
work, probably produced by an inferior artist.</p>

<p>After 1486 Bellaert disappears, and most of his
cuts and types are found in the possession of Gerard
Leeu, who, since his removal to Antwerp, had
lacked the help of a good engraver. He apparently
secured the services of Bellaert's artist, and now
printed French and Dutch editions of the romance
of <i>Paris and Vienne</i> (May 1487), an edition of
<i>Reynard the Fox</i>, of which only a fragment remains,
the already-mentioned edition of <i>Ludolphus</i>, for
which he used cuts both new and old, a <i>Kintscheyt
Jhesu</i> (1488), Dutch and Latin versions of the
story of the Seven Wise Men of Rome, who saved
the young prince from the wiles of his step-mother,
and numerous religious works. At the time of his
death, in 1493, he was engaged on an edition of
the <i>Cronycles of England</i>, which has on its title-page
a fine quarto cut showing the shield of England
supported by angels.<!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1485 Leeu had copied (Sir Martin Conway
says, 'borrowed,' but this is a mistake) blocks
from Anton Sorg, of Augsburg, for an edition of
<i>Æsop</i>, and in 1491, in his <i>Duytsche Ghetiden</i>, he
employed a set of woodcuts imitated from those
in use in the French <i>Horae</i>. Sir Martin assigns
these directly to a French wood-cutter, but the
work, both in the cuts and the borders, appears to
me sufficiently distinctive to be set down rather as
an imitation than as produced by a foreign artist.
Its success was immediate, and the designs appear
in half a dozen books printed by Leeu during the
next two years, and in nine others issued by
Lieseveldt, their purchaser, between 1493 and the
end of the century.</p>

<p>We must now look very briefly at some of the
illustrated books printed in other Dutch towns. At
Zwolle, from 1484 onwards, Peter van Os issued a
large number of devotional works, the cuts in many
of which were copied from sets made for Leeu.
This, however, is not the case with a folio cut of
the Virgin manifesting herself to S. Bernard, which
is given as a frontispiece to three editions of the
Saint's <i>Sermons</i> (1484, &amp;c.), and is of great beauty.
At Delft, Jacob van der Meer also copied Leeu's
books; in 1483 he produced an original set of
illustrations to the ever-popular <i>Scaeckspul</i> of
Jacobus de Cessolis, and three years later, a <i>Passionael</i>,
with upwards of ninety cuts, which were
used again and again in more than a score of similar<!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
works or editions. He was succeeded by Christian
Snellaert, who, in 1491, endeavoured to imitate
Leeu's French cuts in an edition of the <i>Kerstenen
Spieghel</i>. John de Westphalia continued to work
at Louvain until 1496, but his illustrated books
were few and unimportant. At Gouda, Gotfrid
de Os, after borrowing blocks from Leeu, when the
latter had departed for Antwerp, issued a few books
with woodcuts, notably the romance of Godfrey of
Boulogne (<i>Historie hertoghe Godeuaerts van Boloen</i>),
and <i>Le Chevalier Délibéré</i> by Olivier de Lamarche,
with sixteen large and very striking woodcuts,
which have been reproduced in facsimile by the
Bibliographical Society from the reprint issued
about the end of the century at Schiedam.</p>

<p>At Deventer, Jacobus de Breda and Richard
Paffroet, from 1486 onwards, printed a large number
of books with single cuts, none of any great importance.
In the last decade of the century, Hugo
Janszoen commissioned several sets of crude religious
cuts, while the illustrated books issued at
Antwerp by Godfrey Back, who had married the
widow of an earlier printer, Mathias van der Goes,
do not seem to have been much better. This decline
of good work Sir Martin Conway attributes
chiefly to the influence of the French woodcuts
introduced by Leeu. 'The characteristic quality,'
he says, 'of the French cuts is the large mass of
delicately cut shade lines which they contain. The
workmen of the Low Countries finding these foreign<!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
cuts rapidly becoming popular, endeavoured to
imitate them, but without bestowing upon their
work that care by which alone any semblance of
French delicacy could be attained. From the
year 1490 onwards, Dutch and Flemish cuts always
contain large masses of clumsily cut shade. The
outlines are rude; the old childishness is gone;
thus the last decade of the fifteenth century is a
decade of decline.'</p>

<p>When we pass from the illustrations to the other
decorations in early Dutch books, we find that
large borders of foliage, boldly but rather coarsely
treated, were used by Veldener in his <i>Fasciculus
Temporum</i> of 1480, and in Gerard Leeu's edition
of the <i>Dyalogus Creaturarum</i> the following year.
Veldener's is accompanied by a fine initial O, in
which the design of the border is carried on. Leeu's
page contains a rather heavy S, and the woodcut
of the faces of the sun and moon.</p>

<p>In 1491, as we have seen, Leeu printed a <i>Psalter
of the Blessed Virgin</i>, by S. Bernard, in imitation of
the French <i>Horae</i>. This has very graceful little
floral borders in small patterns on grounds alternately
black and white. After Leeu's death, they
passed into the possession of Adrian van Lieseveldt,
who used them for a <i>Duytsche Ghetyden</i> in 1495.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy initial letters are the five
alphabets, printed in red, used by John of Westphalia.
In the smallest the letters are a third of
an inch square, in the largest about an inch and a<!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span><!-- Page 205 --><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>
quarter. This and the next size are picked out
with white scroll-work, somewhat in the same way
as Schoeffer's. Peter van Os at Zwolle used a large
N, four inches square, with intertwining foliage.
He had also a fount of rustic capitals, almost undecipherable.
Leeu, besides his large S, had several
good alphabets of initials. A very beautiful D, reproduced
by Holtrop from the <i>Vier Uterste</i> (Quatuor
novissima) of 1488, is much the most graceful letter
in any Dutch book. No other initials of the same
style have been found. Eckert van Hombergh also
had some good initials, in which the ground is completely
covered with a light floral design. Gotfrid
van Os at Gouda, M. van der Goes at Antwerp, Jacob
Jacobsoen at Delft, and Lud. de Ravescoet at
Louvain, were the chief other possessors of initials,
the use of which continued for a long time to be
very partial.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 264px;">

<span class="caption">Mark of Jacob Bellaert.</span>
</div>

<p>Several of the devices of the Dutch printers are
very splendid. The borders which surrounded the
unicorn of H. Eckert van Hombergh and the eagle
of Jacob Bellaert give them special magnificence.
The Castle at Antwerp was used as a device by
Gerard Leeu, and subsequently by Thierry Martens,
and a printer at Gouda placed a similar erection on
an elephant, perhaps as a pun between <i>howdah</i> and
Gouda. Peter van Os at Zwolle had a large device
of an angel holding a shield; M. van der Goes at
Antwerp a still larger one of a ragged man flourishing
a club, while his shield displays a white lion on a<!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
black ground. Another Antwerp printer, G. Back,
used several varieties of bird-cages as his marks, in
one of which the Antwerp castle is introduced on
a shield hanging from the cage. Several printers&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
Colard Mansion at Bruges, Jacob Jacobsoen at
Delft, and Gerard Leeu at Gouda, contented themselves
with small devices of a pair of shields braced
together. Leeu, however, while at Gouda, used
also a large device of a helmeted shield supported
by two lions.</p>

<h3>SPAIN</h3>


<p>Since the first edition of this book appeared knowledge
both of Spanish incunabula and the types in
which they are printed has been greatly increased,
thanks to the researches of Professor Haebler.
These have dealt incidentally, but only incidentally,
with the illustration and decoration of early
Spanish books, and the present writer must still
confine himself mainly to the little handful of
illustrated books which have come under his own
notice.</p>

<p>The book-hand in use in Spain's manuscripts
during the fifteenth century was unusually massive
and handsome, and the same characteristics naturally
reappear in the majority of the types used by
the early printers in Spain. A considerable proportion
of these were Germans, whose tradition of
good press-work was very fairly maintained by
their immediate successors, so that throughout a
great part of the sixteenth century Spanish books
retain much of the primitive dignity which we are
wont to associate only with 'incunabula.' From
a very early period, also, they are distinguished
by the excellence of their initial letters, which are<!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
almost as plentiful as they are good; the great
majority of books printed after 1485, which I have
seen, being fully provided with them. The prevailing
form of initial exhibits very delicate white
tracery on a black ground. In a few instances, as
in a <i>Seneca</i> printed by Meinardo Ungut and Stanislao
Polono, at Seville, in 1491, some of the initials are
in red, and have a very decorative effect. A fine
capital L and A appear in a work of Jean de Mena,
issued by these printers in 1499, and a good M in
their <i>Claros Varones</i> of Pulgar in the following year.
A <i>Consolat</i>, printed, it is said, by Pedro Posa at
Barcelona in 1494, is very remarkable for its profusion
of fine initials. Engraved borders are not
of common occurrence in Spanish books, though I
shall have to notice two striking instances of their
use in books printed at Zamora and Valencia.
Borders are found, also, on the title-pages of various
laws printed at Barcelona during the reign of
Ferdinand and Isabella, but these are of no great
beauty, and some of the pieces of which they are
composed are poor copies from the French <i>Horae</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule, Spanish title-pages are handsome and
imposing. During the last few years of the fifteenth
century and the beginning of its successor, the
titles of books were often printed in large woodcut
letters. A Spanish <i>Livy</i>, printed at Salamanca
in 1497, a <i>Vocabulary</i> of Antonio Lebrixa, printed
by Kromberger at Seville in 1506, and a <i>Mar
de Istorias</i> printed at Valladolid in 1512, supply<!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
examples of this practice. In an <i>Obra a llaors del
benauenturat lo senyor sant Cristofol</i>, printed at
Valencia in 1498, the woodcut title is in white on a
black ground, which is also relieved by a medallion
of the saint fording the stream. Pictures were also
used in connection with the more ordinary woodcut
titles in black&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in Juan de Lucena's <i>Tratado
de la vita beata</i>, printed by Juan de Burgos in 1502,
we have a cut of a king, bearing his sword of justice
and surrounded by his counsellors; and in a <i>Libro
de Consolat tractant dels fets maritims</i> of the same
year, printed by Johan Luschner at Barcelona,
beneath the woodcut title there is a large figure
of a ship up whose masts sailors are climbing,
apparently in quest of a very prominent moon.</p>

<p>Woodcut pictures of the hero decorate the title-pages
of the romances of Spain as of other countries,
and these pictorial title-pages are found also, though
less frequently, in works of devotion and in plays.
Such pictures are less common in Spain than elsewhere,
because of the great popularity there of the
heraldic title-page, in which the arms of the country,
or of the hero or patron of the work, form a singularly
successful method of ornament. These heraldic
title-pages are found in a few books, printed before
1500, and were in common use throughout the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The earliest Spanish illustrated book with which
I am acquainted is the <i>Libro delos Trabajos de
Hercules</i> of the Marquis Enrique de Villena, printed<!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
by Antonio de Centenera at Zamora, on January
15th, 1483 (1484). This has eleven woodcuts,
illustrating the hero's exploits, and so rudely
executed that they are plainly the work of a native
artist. Far more interesting than these 'prentice
cuts are the illustrative initials, apparently engraved
on soft metal, in a <i>Copilacion de Leyes</i>, promulgated
in 1485, and supposed to have been
printed by Centenera in the same year. These
initials are nine in number, and must have been
designed and executed by finished artists, whose
work is so fine that the printer in most instances has
failed to do justice to it. On the first page of text
an initial P contains within it figures of a king and
queen, Ferdinand and Isabella. This page has at
its foot a border containing a hunting scene, with a
blank shield in its centre. The rest of the page is
surrounded by a text, printed decoratively, so as to
form an open-work border. The first section of the
laws, treating of 'la Santa Fe,' has an initial E,
showing God the Father upholding the crucified
Christ. The second section sets forth the duty of
the king to hear causes two days a week, and begins
with an L, here reproduced, in which the king is
unpleasantly close pressed by the litigants.</p>

<p>Two knights spurring from the different sides
of an S head the laws of chivalry; a Canonist and
his scholars in an A preside over Matrimony;
money-changers in a D over Commerce, while a
luckless wretch being hanged in the midst of a T<!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
warns evil-doers of what they may expect under
the criminal law. The pages containing these
initials are enriched also by a border in two pieces,
the lower part of which shows a shield, with a
device of trees, supported by kneeling youths. The
perpendicular piece running up the outer margin
bears a floral design. All the letters, while directly
illustrating the subjects of the chapters which they
begin, are at the same time essentially decorative,
and they are certainly the best pictorial initials I
have ever seen, though it must be reckoned against
them that they were unduly difficult to print with
the text.</p>

<p>The page here reproduced, unfortunately only
about one-third of its original size, from the famous
romance of <i>Tirant lo Blanch</i>, gives us another<!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
example of this peculiar style of engraving. It is
taken from the edition printed at Valencia in 1490,
and may fairly be reckoned as one of the most
decorative pages in any fifteenth-century book. The
rest of the volume has no other ornament than some
good initials.</p>

<p>The first Spanish book with woodcuts of any
artistic merit with which I am acquainted is an
edition of Diego de San Pedro's <i>Carcel d'Amor</i>,
printed at Barcelona in 1493. This has sixteen
different cuts, some of which are several times
repeated. The title-cut, showing love's prison, is
here reproduced, and gives a very good idea of a
characteristic Spanish woodcut. The other illustrations
show the lover in various attitudes before
his lady, a meeting in a street, the author at work
on his book, &amp;c. Another edition of the <i>Carcel
d'Amor</i>, with the same woodcuts, was printed at
Burgos in 1496 by Fadrique Aleman.</p>

<span class="caption">Title-page of Diego de San Pedro&#39;s <i>Carcel d&#39;Amor</i>, Barcelona, 1493.</span>
</div>

<p>Most of the other Spanish incunabula with woodcuts,
which I have seen, were printed at Seville by
Meinardo Ungut and Stanislao Polono. The first
of these, Gorricio's <i>Contemplaciones sobre el Rosario
de nuestra señora</i>, issued in 1495, has some good
initials, two large cuts nearly the full size of the
quarto page, and fifteen smaller ones, with graceful
borders mostly on a black ground. The small cuts
illustrate the life of Christ and of the B. Virgin,
and are, to some extent, modelled on the pictures
in the French <i>Horae</i>. In the same year, the same<!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span><!-- Page 215 --><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>
printers published Ayala's <i>Chronica del Rey don
Pedro</i>, with a title-cut of a young king, seated on
his throne, and also the <i>Lilio de Medicina</i> of B.
de Gordonio with a title-cut of lilies. In 1496, a
firm of four printers, 'Paulo de Colonia, Juan
Pegnicer de Nuremberg, Magno y Thomas,' published
an edition of Juan de Mena's <i>Labirinto</i> or
<i>Las CCC</i> (so called from the number of stanzas in
which it is written) with a title-cut of the author (?)
kneeling before a king. Three years later, still at
Seville, Pedro Brun printed in quarto the romance
of the Emperor <i>Vespasian</i>, with fourteen full-page
cuts of sea voyages, sieges, the death of Pilate, &amp;c.
Against these books printed at Seville, during
the last decade of the century, I have only notes
of one or two books issued at Salamanca, Valencia,
and Barcelona, with unimportant title-cuts, and a
reprint at Burgos of the <i>Trabajos de Hercules</i> (1499)
with poor illustrations fitted into the columns
of a folio page. But it is quite possible that my
knowledge is as one-sided as it is limited, and I
must, therefore, refrain from building up any theory
that Seville, rather than any other town, was the
chief home of illustrated books in Spain. After
1500 the Spanish books which I have met have
no important illustrations beyond the cuts which
appear on some of their title-pages. But here,
also, I should be sorry to make my small experience
the basis of a general statement.</p>

<p>The devices of the Spanish printers were greatly<!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
influenced by those of their compeers of Italy and
France. The simple circle and cross, in white on a
black ground, with the printer's initials in the semicircles,
is fairly common, while Diego de Gumiel
and Arnaldo Guillermo Brocar varied it, according
to the best Italian fashion, with very beautiful
floral tracery. The tree of knowledge and pendant
shields, beloved of the French printers, appear in
the marks of Meinardo Ungut and Stanislao Polono,
and of Juan de Rosembach. Arnaldo Guillermo
had another and very elaborate mark, showing a
man kneeling before the emblems of the Passion,
and two angels supporting a shield with a device
of a porcupine. One of the quaintest of all printers'
marks was used by a later printer of the name
Juan Brocar, whose motto 'legitime certanti' is
illustrated by a mail-clad soldier grasping a lady's
hair while he himself is being seized by the devil!<!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>ENGLAND</h3>

<p class="center"><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">E. Gordon Duff</span></p>


<p>The art of the wood-engraver may almost be said
to have had no existence in England before the
introduction of printing, for there are not probably
more than half a dozen cuts now known, if indeed
so many, that are of an earlier date. The few that
exist are devotional prints of the type known as
the 'Image of Pity,' in which a half-length figure
of Christ on the cross stands surrounded with the
emblems of the Passion.</p>

<p>It may be taken, I think, for granted that at the
time Caxton set up his press at Westminster, that
is, in the year 1476, there was no wood-engraver
competent to undertake the work of illustrating his
books. We see, for instance, that in the first
edition of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> there are no woodcuts,
while they appear in the second edition; and
it is not likely that Caxton would have left a book
so eminently suited for illustration without some
such adornment had the necessary craftsmen been
available. As it was, it was not till 1480 that
woodcuts first appeared in an English printed book,<!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the <i>Mirror of the World</i>. In this there are two
series of cuts. One, consisting of diagrams, is
found in most of the <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> of the book; the other,
which represents masters teaching their scholars
or at work alone, was a new departure of Caxton's.
It is quite probable that they were intended for
general use in books, indeed we find some used in
the <i>Cato</i>, but they do not appear to have been
employed elsewhere. The diagrams are meagre
and difficult to understand, so much so that the
printer has printed several in their wrong places.
The necessary letterpress occurring within them is
not printed (Caxton had not then a small enough
type), but is written in by hand, and it is worth
noticing that this is done in all copies in the same
hand, and so must have been done in Caxton's office,
some are fond enough to suppose by Caxton himself.</p>

<p>In the next year appeared the second edition of
the <i>Game of Chesse</i>, with a number of woodcuts.
The first edition, printed at Bruges by Caxton and
Mansion, had no illustrations. The cuts are coarsely
designed and roughly cut, but serve their purpose;
indeed, they are evidently intended as illustrations
rather than ornaments. Some controversy has at
different times arisen as to whether these cuts were
executed in England or abroad, but Mr. Linton
has very justly decided in favour of England. The
work, he says, is so poor that any one who could
hold a knife could cut them, therefore there was no
necessity to send abroad.<!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>About 1484 we have two important illustrated
books, the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> and the <i>Æsop</i>; the
former with 28 illustrations, the latter with 186.</p>

<p>The cuts of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> depict for the
most part the various individuals of the Pilgrimage,
and there is also a bird's-eye view of all the pilgrims
seated at an immense round table at supper, which
was used afterwards by Wynkyn de Worde for the
'Assembly of Gods.' The copies of German cuts in
the <i>Æsop</i>, with the exception of the full-page frontispiece
(known only in the copy in the Windsor Library),
are smaller, and are the work of two, if not three,
engravers. One cut seems to have been hurriedly
executed in a different manner to the rest, perhaps
to take the place of one injured at the last moment.
It is not worked in the usual manner with the outlines
in black&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> raised lines on the wood-block,
but a certain amount of the effect has been produced
by a white line on a black ground&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> by
the cut-away lines of the wood-block.</p>

<p>The <i>Golden Legend</i>, which was the next illustrated
book to appear, contains the most ambitious woodcuts
which Caxton used. Those in the earlier part
are the full width of a large folio page, and show,
especially in their backgrounds, a certain amount of
technical skill. The later part of the book contains
a number of small cuts of saints very coarsely executed,
and the same cut is used over and over again
for different saints.</p>

<p>In 1487 Caxton first used his large woodcut device,<!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
which is probably, though the contrary is often
asserted, of English workmanship. It is entirely un-French
in style and execution, and was probably
cut to print on the Missal printed by Maynyal for
Caxton in order that the publisher might be brought
prominently into notice.</p>

<p>About this time (1487-88) two more illustrated
books were issued,&mdash;the <i>Royal Book</i> and the <i>Speculum
Vite Christi</i>. The series cut for the <i>Speculum</i>
are of very good workmanship, though the designs
are poor, but all of them were not used in the book.
One or two appear later in books printed by W.
de Worde, manifestly from the same series. The
<i>Royal Book</i> contains only seven cuts, six of which
are from the <i>Speculum</i>. Some of the cuts occur
also in the <i>Doctrinal of Sapience</i> and the <i>Book of
Divers Ghostly Matters</i>.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to think when examining
Caxton's books that the use of woodcuts was rather
forced upon him by the necessities of his business,
than deliberately preferred by himself. He seems to
have wished to popularise the more generally known
books, and only to have used woodcuts when the
book absolutely needed them. He did not, as some
later printers did, simply use woodcuts to attract
the unwary purchaser.</p>

<p>What cuts Caxton possessed at the end of his
career it is hard to determine. The set of large
<i>Horae</i> cuts which W. de Worde used must have been
Caxton's, for we find one of them, the Crucifixion,<!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
used in the <i>Fifteen O'es</i>, which was itself intended as
a supplement to a <i>Horae</i>, now unknown. In the
same way there must have been a number of cuts
for use in the 8vo <i>Horae</i>, but as that is known only
from a small fragment, we cannot identify them.
From similarity of style and identity of measurement
we can pick out a few from Wynkyn de
Worde's later editions, but many must be passed
over.</p>

<p>On turning to examine the presses at work at
the same time as Caxton's one cannot but be struck
by the scarcity of illustrations. Lettou and Machlinia,
though they produced over thirty books, had
no ornaments that we know of beyond a border
which was used in their edition of the <i>Horae ad
usum Sarum</i>, and passed into the hands of Pynson.
They seem to have been without everything except
type, not having even initial letters.</p>

<p>The St. Alban's press was a step in advance. A
few cuts were used in the <i>Chronicles</i>, and the <i>Book
of St. Alban's</i> contains coats of arms, produced by a
combination of wood-cutting and printing in colour.</p>

<p>The Oxford press was the most ambitious, and
was in possession of two sets of cuts, in neither
case intended for the books in which they were
used. One set was prepared for a <i>Golden Legend</i>,
but no such book is known to have been issued at
the Oxford press. One of these cuts appears as
a frontispiece to Lyndewode's <i>Constitutions</i>. It represents
Jacobus de Voragine writing the <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><i>Golden
Legend</i>, so that it did equally well for Lyndewode
writing his law-book. Others of the series are
used in the <i>Liber Festialis</i> of 1486, but as that was
a small folio and the cuts were large, the ends were
cut off, and they are all printed in a mutilated
condition. The other cuts used in the <i>Festial</i>
are small, and form part of a set for a <i>Horae</i>, but
no <i>Horae</i> is known to have been printed at the
Oxford press. It would be natural to suppose in
this case that these cuts had been procured from
some other printer who had used them in the production
of the books for which they were intended;
but the most careful search has failed to find them
in any other book. Besides these cuts the Oxford
press owned a very beautiful border, which was
used in the commentary on the <i>De Anima</i> of Aristotle
by Alexander de Hales and the commentary
on the <i>Lamentations of Jeremiah</i> by John Lattebury,
printed in 1481 and 1482. The printers
owned nothing else for the adornment of their
books but a rudely cut capital G, which we find
used many times in the <i>Festial</i>.</p>

<p>The poverty of ornamental letters and borders is
very noticeable in all the English presses of the
fifteenth century. Caxton possessed one ambitious
letter, a capital A, which was used first in the <i>Order
of Chivalry</i>, and a series of eight borders, each made
up of four pieces, and found for the first time in the
<i>Fifteen O'es</i>. They are of little merit, and compare
very unfavourably with French work of the period.<!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
The best set of borders used in England belonged
to Notary and his partners when they started in
London about 1496. They are in the usual style,
with dotted backgrounds, and may very likely
have been brought from France. Pynson's borders,
which he used in a <i>Horae</i> about 1495, are much
more English in style, but are not good enough to
make the page really attractive; in fact almost
the only fine specimens of English printing with
borders are to be found in the Morton <i>Missal</i>,
which he printed in 1500. In this book also there
are fine initial letters, often printed in red. It is
hard to understand why, as a rule, English initial
letters were so very bad; it certainly was not
from the want of excellent models, for those in
the Sarum missals, printed at Venice by Hertzog
in 1494, and sold in England by Frederic
Egmont, contain most beautifully designed initials,
as good as can be found in any early printed
book.</p>

<p>Wynkyn de Worde, when he succeeded in 1491
to Caxton's business, found himself in possession
of a large number of cuts, a considerably larger
number than ever appeared in the books of Caxton's
that now remain to us. The first illustrated book
he issued was a new edition of the <i>Golden Legend</i>, in
which the old cuts were utilised. This was printed
in 1493. In 1494 a new edition of the <i>Speculum
Vite Christi</i> was issued, of which only one complete
copy is known, that in the library at Holkham. It<!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
probably contains only the series of cuts used by
Caxton in his edition, for the few leaves to be found
in other libraries have no new illustrations. About
the same time (1494) De Worde issued several editions
of the <i>Horae ad usum Sarum</i>, one in octavo
(known from a few leaves discovered in the binding
of a book in the library of Corpus Christi College,
Oxford) and the rest in quarto. In the quarto
editions we find the large series of pictures, among
which are the three rioters and three skeletons,
the tree of Jesse, and the Crucifixion, which occur
in Caxton's <i>Fifteen O'es</i>. It is extremely probable
that all the cuts in these editions had belonged
to Caxton. The two cuts in the fragment of
the octavo edition, however, are of quite a different
class, evidently newly cut, and much superior in
style and simplicity to Caxton's. It is much to be
regretted that no complete copy of the book exists,
for the neat small cuts and bold red and black
printing form a very tasteful page.</p>

<p>A curious specimen of engraving is to be found
in the <i>Scala Perfectionis</i>, by Walter Hylton, also
printed in 1494. It represents the Virgin and
Child seated under an architectural canopy, and
below this are the words of the antiphon beginning,
'Sit dulce nomen d[=n]i.' These words are not
printed from type, but cut on the block, and the
engraver seems to have treated them simply as
part of the decoration, for many of the words
are by themselves quite unreadable and bear only<!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
a superficial resemblance to the inscription from
which they were copied.</p>

<p>An edition of Bartholomaeus' <i>De proprietatibus
rerum</i> issued about this time has a number of cuts,
not of very great interest; and the <i>Book of St. Albans</i>
of 1496 has an extra chapter on fishing, illustrated
with a picture of an angler at work, with a tub, in
the German fashion, to put his fish into. It has also
a curiously modern diagram of the sizes of hooks.
In 1498 De Worde issued an illustrated edition of
Malory's <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>. The cuts are very ambitious,
but badly executed, and the hand of the
engraver who cut them may be traced in several
books. In 1499 an edition of <i>Mandeville</i> was
issued, ornamented with a number of small cuts,
and about this time several small books were issued
having cuts on the title-page.</p>

<p>Richard Pynson's first illustrated book was an
edition of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, printed some time
before 1492. At the head of each tale is a rudely
executed cut of the pilgrim who narrates it. These
cuts were made for this edition, and were in some
cases altered while the book was going through the
press to serve for different characters: the Squire
and the Manciple, the Sergeant and Doctor of
Physic, are from the same blocks with slight alterations.
In 1494 came an edition of Lydgate's
<i>Falle of Princis</i>, a translation from the <i>De Casibus
virorum et feminarum illustrium</i> of Boccaccio,
illustrated with the cuts used by Jean Dupré<!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
in his Paris edition of a French version of the
same work in 1483. One of the neatest of these,
depicting Marcus Manlius thrown into the Tiber,
is here shown. About 1497 an edition of the
<i>Speculum Vite Christi</i> was issued, with a number of
neatly executed small cuts, and in 1500 Pynson
printed the beautiful Sarum Missal, known as the
<i>Morton Missal</i>. Special borders and ornaments,
introducing a rebus on the name of Morton, were
engraved for this, and a full-page cut of the pre<!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>late's
coat of arms appears at the commencement
of the book.</p>

<span class="caption">The Death of Marcus Manlius. From Lydgate&#39;s <i>The Falle of
Princis</i>, Pynson, 1494. (Reduced.)</span>
</div>

<p>After the year 1500 almost every book issued by
W. de Worde, who was pre-eminently the popular
publisher, had an illustration on the title-page.
This was not always cut for the book, nor indeed
always very applicable to the letterpress, and the
cuts can almost all be arranged into series made
for more important books. There were, however,
a few stock cuts: a schoolmaster with a gigantic
birch for grammars, a learned man seated at a
desk for works of more advanced scholarship, and
lively pictures of hell for theological treatises. The
title-page was formed on a fixed plan. At the
top, printed inside a wood-cut ribbon, was placed
the title, below this the cut.</p>

<p>Pynson, who was the Royal printer, and a publisher
of learned works, disdained such attempts
to catch the more vulgar buyers. His title-pages
rarely have cuts, and these are only used on such
few popular books as he issued. Both he and De
Worde had a set of narrow upright cuts of men and
women with blank labels over their heads, which
could be used for any purpose, and have the names
printed in type in the label above.</p>

<p>Foreign competition was also at this time making
its influence felt on English book-illustration. W.
de Worde had led the way by purchasing from
Godfried van Os, about 1492, some type initial
letters, and at least one woodcut. Pynson, early<!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
in the sixteenth century, obtained some cuts from
Vérard, which he used in his edition of the <i>Kalendar
of Shepherdes</i>, 1506, and Julian Notary, who began
printing about 1496, seems to have made use of
a miscellaneous collection of cuts obtained from
various quarters. He had, amongst other curious
things, part of a set of metal cuts executed in the
<i>manière criblée</i>, which have not been traced to any
other book, but appear to have passed at a considerably
later date into the hands of Wyer, who
commenced to print before 1524. When W. de
Worde left Westminster in 1500 to settle in Fleet
Street, he parted with some of his old woodcuts
to Notary,&mdash;woodcuts which had been used in the
<i>Horae</i> of 1494, and had originally belonged to
Caxton. All these miscellaneous cuts appear in
his <i>Golden Legend</i> of 1503, and the large cut of the
'Assembly of Saints' on the title-page seems also
to have been borrowed. It was used by Hopyl
at Paris in 1505 for his edition of the <i>Golden Legend</i>
in Dutch, and passed afterwards with Hopyl's
business to his son-in-law Prevost, who used it in
a theological work of John Major's. The engraved
metal ornamental initials were obtained from André
Bocard.</p>

<p>Some time before 1510 an extremely curious
book, entitled the <i>Passion of our Lorde Jesu</i>, was
printed abroad, probably in Paris. The uncouthness
of the language seems to have brought about
its destruction; for, though many fragments have<!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
been found in bindings, only one perfect copy,
now in the Bodleian, is known. It contains a
number of large cuts of a very German appearance
and quite unlike any others of the period. Some
are used also in the York <i>Manual</i> printed for De
Worde in 1509.</p>

<p>About this time too a number of popular books
in English, some adorned with rude woodcuts, were
issued by John of Doesborch, a printer in Antwerp.
Among them may be mentioned <i>The wonderful
shape and nature of man, beasts, serpents, &amp;c.</i>, the
<i>Fifteen Tokens</i>, the <i>Story of the Parson of Kalenbrowe</i>,
and the <i>Life of Virgilius</i>. A still earlier
Antwerp cut, which had been used by Gerard Leeu
for the title-page of his English <i>Solomon and Marcolphus</i>,
found its way to England and was used
by Copland.</p>

<p>In the last years of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>'s reign, from 1501
to 1509, a few books may be mentioned as particularly
interesting from their illustrations. In
1502 De Worde printed the <i>Ordinary of Chrysten
Men</i>, a large book with a block-printed title. It
was reprinted in 1506. In 1503 appeared the
<i>Recuyles of y<sup>e</sup> Hystoryes of Troye</i>, a typical example
of an illustrated book of the period. There are
about seventy cuts of all kinds, of which twelve
were specially cut for the book: many others were
used in the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, and the rest are miscellaneous.
In 1505 we have the '<i>Craft to live and
die well</i>,' of which there is another edition in the<!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
following year. In 1506 appears the <i>Castle of
Labour</i>, one of the few books entirely illustrated
with cuts specially made for it; in 1508 the
<i>Kalendar of Shepherdes</i>. The cuts in these last
three books were all ultimately derived from French
originals. An edition of the <i>Seven Wise Masters of
Rome</i>, of which the only known copy is imperfect,
appeared about 1506, though the cuts which illustrate
it were made before 1500. The fragment
contains seven cuts, but the set must have consisted
of eleven. They are very careful copies of those
used by Gerard Leeu in his edition of 1490, and
have lost none of the feeling of the originals.</p>

<p>Three books only of Pynson's production during
this period call for special notice. About 1505 he
issued an edition of the <i>Castle of Labour</i>, with very
well-cut illustrations closely copied from the French
edition. In 1506 appeared his edition of the
<i>Kalendar of Shepherdes</i>, which is illustrated for the
most part with cuts obtained from Vérard, and
in 1507 an edition of the <i>Golden Legend</i>. Of each
of these books but one copy is known.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason, the accession of
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> acted in the most extraordinary way
upon the English presses, which in that year issued
a very large number of books. Perhaps the influx
of visitors to London on that occasion made an
unusual demand; but at any rate a number of
popular books were then issued. Amongst them
are <i>Rychard Cuer de Lyon</i>, the <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span><i>Fiftene Joyes of
Maryage</i>, the <i>Convercyon of Swerers</i>, the <i>Parliament
of Devils</i>, and many others. Besides these there
were, of course, a number of funeral sermons on
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, many of which have curious frontispieces.
One of these was used again a little later,
for the funeral sermon of the King's mother, the
Lady Margaret, the royal pall and effigy on it
being cut out and replaced by an ordinary pall.
This method of inserting new pieces into old blocks,
technically termed plugging, was not much used at
this period when wood-engraving was so cheap.
An excellent example, however, will be found in
the books printed for William Bretton, which contain
a large coat of arms. A mistake was made
in the cutting of the arms, and a new shield was
inserted, the mantling and supporters being untouched.
Another notable book of that period is
Barclay's <i>Ship of Fools</i>, issued by Pynson in 1509.
It contains one hundred and eighteen cuts, the
first being a full-page illustration of the printer's
coat of arms. The rest are copies, roughly executed,
of those in the original edition. Another
version of this book, translated by Henry Watson,
was issued the same year by Wynkyn de Worde.
It is illustrated with a special series of cuts, which
are used again in the later editions. Of the original
edition of 1509 only one copy is known, printed on
vellum and preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale.
Stray cuts from this series are found in several of
De Worde's other books, but may be at once<!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
recognised from the occurrence of the 'fool' in his
typical cap and bells.</p>

<p>About this time and a little earlier the title was
very often cut entire on a block. The <i>De Proprietatibus</i>
of <i>c.</i> 1496 contains the first and the most
elaborate specimen, in which the words 'Bartholomeus
de proprietatibus rerum' are cut in enormous
letters on a wooden board; indeed the whole block
was so large that hardly any copy contains the
whole. Faques, Pynson, and others used similar
blocks, in which the letters were white and the
background black (one of Pynson's printed in red
is to be found in the <i>Ortus Vocabulorum</i> of 1509),
but their uncouthness soon led to their disuse.
Numbers of service books were issued by Pynson
and Wynkyn de Worde, profusely illustrated with
small cuts, most of which appear to have been of
home manufacture, though unoriginal in design.
It is worth noticing one difference in the cuts of
the two printers. Pynson's small cuts have generally
an open or white background, De Worde's
are, as a rule, dotted in the French style. Since in
some of their service books these two printers used
exactly similar founts of type the identification of
their cuts is of particular value. But these service
books almost from the first began to deteriorate.
The use of borders was abandoned, and little care
was given to keeping sets of cuts together, or using
those of similar styles in one book. We find the
archaic cuts of Caxton, the delicate pictures copied<!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
from French models, and roughly designed and
executed English blocks all used together, sometimes
even on the same page. The same thing is
noticeable in all the illustrated books of the period.
De Worde used Caxton's cuts up to the very end of
his career, though in many cases the blocks were
worm-eaten or broken. The peculiar mixture of
cuts is very striking in some books. Take as an
example the edition of <i>Robert the Devil</i>, published
about 1514. No cut used in it is original: one is
from a book on good living and dying, another
from the <i>Ship of Fools</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> a third is from a devotional
book of the previous century, and so on. In the
<i>Oliver of Castile</i> of 1518, though there are over
sixty illustrations, not more than three or four
are specially cut for it, but come from the <i>Morte
d'Arthur</i>, the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, <i>Helias Knight of
the Swan</i>, the <i>Body of Policy</i>, <i>Richard Cuer de Lion</i>,
the <i>Book of Carving</i>, and so on, and perhaps many
are used in several. Indeed, W. de Worde minded
as little about using the same illustrations over and
over again as some of our modern publishers.</p>

<p>For all books issued in the early years of the sixteenth
century it was thought necessary to have at
least an illustration on the title-page, so that practically
an examination of the illustrated books of<!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the period means almost an examination of the
entire produce of the printing press. In time,
when the subject has been thoroughly studied, it
will be possible to separate all the cuts into series
cut for some special purpose.</p>

<p>A rather important influence was introduced
into the history of English book illustration about
1518, when Pynson obtained a series of borders
and other material, closely imitated from the
designs made by Holbein for Froben.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> They
are the first important examples of 'renaissance'
design used in English books, and their effect was
rapid and marked. Wynkyn de Worde, who in his
devices had hitherto been content to use Caxton's
trade-mark with some few extra ornaments, introduced
a hideous parody of one of Froben's devices,
poor in design, and wretched in execution. The
series of borders used by Pynson were good in execution,
and their style harmonised with the Roman
type used by him at that time, but with other books
it was different. The heavy English black letter
required something bolder, and unless these borders
were heavily cut, they looked particularly meagre.
A very beautiful title-page of this type (here somewhat
reduced) is that in Sir Thomas Elyot's <i>Image
of Governance</i>, printed by Thomas Berthelet at
London in 1540-41.<!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

alt="Title-page of Sir Thomas Elyot's Image of Governance." title="linked to larger image" /></a>
</div>

<p>The illustrated books of this period offer a curious<!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
mixture of styles, for nothing could be more opposed
in feeling than the early school of English cuts and
the newly introduced Renaissance designs. The
outsides of the books underwent exactly the same<!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
change, for in place of the old pictorial blocks with
which the stationers had heretofore stamped their
bindings, they used hideous combinations of medallions
and pillars.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
<a href="images/i_247.jpg"><img src="images/i_247_tn.jpg" width="284" height="400" alt="" title="linked to larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">Device of Thomas Berthelet.</span>
</div>

<p>The device of Berthelet is an excellent specimen
of the new style. Despising good old English names
and signs, he carried on business at the sign of
Lucretia Romana in Fleet Street, and his device depicts
that person in the act of thrusting a sword into
her bosom. In the background is a classical landscape,
and on either side pillars. Above are festoons,
and on ribbons at the head and feet of the
figure the name of the printer and of his sign.
Though the cut is uninteresting it is a beautiful
piece of work.</p>

<p>Another result of the new movement was the
banishment of woodcuts from the title-page. Those
to Pynson's books have already been noticed, but
lesser printers like Scot, Godfrey, Rastell, and
Treveris also made use of borders of classical
design, and gave up the use of woodcuts. It is
extremely curious to notice what excellent effects
on a title-page the printers at this time produced
from the poorest materials. They seem to have
understood much better than those of a later date
how to use different sized type with effect, and to
make the whole page pleasing, without attracting
too much attention to one particular part.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 295px;">
<a href="images/i_249.jpg"><img src="images/i_249_tn.jpg" width="295" height="400" alt="" title="linked to larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">Device of Richard Faques.</span>
</div>

<p>Before leaving this early period it will be as
well to return a little, and briefly notice some of<!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the more marked illustrated books produced by
printers other than Pynson and De Worde. The
two printers of the name of Faques, Guillam and
Richard, produced a few most interesting books,
and the device of the last named, founded on that
of the Paris printer, Thielman Kerver, is a fine
piece of engraving. The name was originally cut<!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
upon the block as Faques, and was so used in his
two first books; but in order to make the name
appear more English in form, the 'ques' was cut
out and 'kes' inserted in type. The last dated
book which he printed, the <i>Mirrour of Our Lady</i>
of 1530, contains several fine illustrations; that
on the reverse of the title-page depicting a woman
of some religious order writing a book, has at the
bottom the letters E. G. joined by a knot, which
may be the initials of the engraver.</p>

<p>The Cambridge press of 1521-1522, from the
scholastic nature of its books, required no illustrations,
but it used for the title-page of the <i>Galen</i>
a woodcut border, rather in the manner of Holbein,
but evidently of native production. In 1536 this
border reappears in a Dutch Prognostication printed
at Antwerp. The Oxford press of the early sixteenth
century borrowed some of its cuts from De
Worde, but a few, such as the ambitious frontispiece
and the four diagrams in the <i>Compotus</i> of
1519, were original.</p>

<p>John Rastell in his <i>Pastyme of People</i> used a
number of full-page illustrations of the kings of
England, coarse in design and execution, and very
remarkable in appearance. Peter Treveris issued a
number of books with illustrations, some of which
are well worthy of notice. The <i>Grete Herbal</i>, first
published in 1516, contained a large number of
cuts. Jerome of Bruynswyke's <i>Worke of Surgeri</i>
has some curious plates of surgical operations, and<!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
though the subjects are rather repulsive, they are
excellent specimens of the wood-cutting of the
period. Treveris' best known book is the <i>Policronicon</i>
of 1527, printed for John Reynes, whose
mark in red generally occurs on the title-page.
This title-page is a fine piece of work, and has
been facsimiled by Dibdin in his <i>Typographical
Antiquities</i>. Some of the cuts and ornaments
used by Treveris passed after his death into
the hands of the Edinburgh printer, Thomas
Davidson.</p>

<p>Lawrence Andrewe of Calais, who printed shortly
before 1530, also issued some curious illustrated
books. Before coming to England he had translated
the extraordinary book, <i>The wonderful shape and
nature of man, beasts, serpentes, &amp;c.</i>, printed by John
of Doesborch, whom we have spoken of above.
On his own account he issued the <i>Boke of distyllacyon
of waters</i> by Jerome of Brunswick, illustrated
with pictures of apparatus, and <i>The Mirror of the
World</i>. This is founded on Caxton's edition, but
is much more fully illustrated, the cuts to the
Natural History portion being particularly curious.
It is worth noticing that Andrewe, like some other
printers at this time, introduced his device into
many of the initial letters and borders which were
cut for him, so that they can be readily identified
when they occur, after his death, in books by
other printers.</p>

<p>After the death of Wynkyn de Worde in 1535,<!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
ideas as regards book-illustration underwent a great
change. Theology had become popular, and theological
books were not adapted for illustration. The
ordinary book, with pictures put in haphazard,
absolutely died out; and cuts were only used in
chap books, or in large illustrated volumes,&mdash;descriptions
of horrible creatures, and the likenesses
of comets or portents on the one hand, chronicles,
books of travel, and scientific works on the other.
The difference which we noticed between W. de
Worde and Pynson, the one being a popular printer
and the other a printer of standard works, is distinctly
marked in the succeeding generation. While
Wyer, Byddell, and Copland published the popular
books, Grafton and Whytchurch, Wolfe and Day,
issued more solid literature. The old woodcuts
passed into the hands of the poorer printers, and
were used till they were worn out, and it is curious
to notice how long in many cases this took. On
the other hand, the illustrations made for new books
are, as a rule, of excellent design and execution,
owing a good deal, in all probability, to the influence
of Holbein, who, for the latter portion of his life,
was living in England. As examples of his work,
we may take two books published in 1548, Cranmer's
<i>Catechism</i>, published by Walter Lynne, and Halle's
<i>Chronicles</i>, published by Grafton. The first contains
a number of small cuts, one of which is signed
in full Hans Holbein, and two others are signed
with his initials H. H. Some writers insist that<!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span><!-- Page 244 --><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>
these three cuts alone are to be ascribed to him,
and that the rest are from an unknown hand. Besides
these small cuts, there is one full-page cut on
the back of the title of very fine work. It represents
Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> seated on his throne with the
bishops kneeling on his right, the peers on his left.
From the hands of the king the bishops are receiving
a Bible. The cut at the end of Halle's <i>Chronicles</i>,
very similarly executed and also ascribed to Holbein,
represents Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> sitting in Parliament. Almost
all the volumes of chronicles, of which a number
were issued in the sixteenth century, contain woodcuts,
and two are especially well illustrated,&mdash;Grafton's
<i>Chronicles</i>, published in 1569, and Holinshed's
<i>Chronicles</i> in 1577. The illustrations in the
latter book, which Mr. Linton considers to have
been cut on metal, do not appear in the later
edition of 1586. Among the illustrations in the
first edition, so Dibdin says, is to be found a picture
of a guillotine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 255px;">
<a href="images/i_253.jpg"><img src="images/i_253_tn.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="" title="linked to larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">From Cranmer&#39;s <i>Catechism</i>, London, 1548.</span>
</div>

<p>Of all the English printers of the latter half of
the sixteenth century, none produced finer books
than John Day, who, it has been suggested,
engraved some of the woodcuts which he used.
The best known, perhaps, of his books is the
<i>Book of Christian Prayers</i>, commonly called Queen
Elizabeth's Prayer Book, which he published in
1569. In a way, this book is undoubtedly a fine
specimen of book-ornamentation, but as it was
executed in a style then out of date, having borders<!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
like the earlier service books, it suffers by comparison
with the 'Books of Hours' of fifty years earlier.
Another book of Day's which obtained great popularity
was the <i>History of Martyrs</i>, compiled by
John Fox. We read on Day's epitaph in the
church of Bradley-Parva&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He set a Fox to wright how martyrs runne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By death to lyfe. Fox ventured paynes and health,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give them light; Day spent in print his wealth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Considering the popularity of the book, and the
number of editions that were issued, we can hardly
imagine that Day lost money upon it. The illustrations
are of varied excellence, but the book
contains also some very fine initial letters. One,
the C at the commencement of the dedication,
contains a portrait of Queen Elizabeth on her
throne, with three men standing beside her, two
of whom are supposed to be Day and Fox. Below
the throne, forming part of the letter, is the Pope
holding two broken keys.</p>

<p>Initial letters about this time arrived at their
best. They were often very large, and contained
scenes, mythological subjects, or coats-of-arms. A
fine specimen of this last class is to be found in
the <i>Cosmographical Glasse</i>, by William Cuningham,
1559. It is a large D containing the arms of Robert,
Lord Dudley, to whom the book is dedicated. Very
soon after this some ingenious printer invented the
system of printing an ornamental border for the<!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
letter with a blank space for the insertion of an
ordinary capital letter,&mdash;a system which soon succeeded
in destroying any beauty or originality
which letters had up to this time possessed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it will be well to notice the growth
of engraving on metal in England. The earliest
specimen that I know of is the device first used by
Pynson about 1496. It is certainly metal, and has
every appearance of having been cut in this country.
Some writers have put forward the theory that the
majority of early illustrations, though to all appearance
woodcuts, were really cut on metal. But
wherever it is possible to trace an individual cut for
any length of time, we can see from the breakages,
and in some cases from small holes bored by insects,
that the material used was certainly wood. Julian
Notary had some curious metal cuts, but they were
certainly of foreign design and workmanship, and the
same may be said of the metal cuts found amongst
the early English service books. The border on the
title-page of the Cambridge <i>Galen</i>, usually described
as engraved on metal, is really an ordinary woodcut.
It is not till 1540 that we find a book illustrated
with engravings produced in this country.
This was Thomas Raynald's <i>Byrth of Mankynde</i>,
which contains four plates of surgical diagrams. In
some of the later editions these plates have been
re-engraved on wood. In 1545 another medical
book appeared, <i>Compendiosa totius delineatio aere
exarata per Thomam Geminum</i>. It has a frontis<!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>piece
with the arms of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, and forty plates
of anatomical subjects. Other editions appeared in
1553 and 1559, and the title-page of the last is
altered by the insertion of a portrait of Elizabeth
in place of the royal arms. The <i>Stirpium Adversaria
nova authoribus Petro Pena et Mathia de
Lobel</i> of 1570 has a beautifully engraved title-page,
and the 1572 edition of Parker's <i>Bible</i> contains a
map of the Holy Land with the following inscription
in an ornamental tablet: 'Graven bi Humfray
Cole, goldsmith, an English man born in y<sup>e</sup>
north, and pertayning to y<sup>e</sup> mint in the Tower,
1572.' Humfray Cole is supposed by some authorities
to have engraved the beautiful portraits of
Elizabeth, the Earl of Leicester, and Lord Burleigh,
which appear in the earlier edition of 1568. Saxton's
maps, which appeared in 1579, are partly the work
of native engravers, for at least eight were engraved
by Augustine Ryther and Nicholas Reynolds.
In 1591 there are two books,&mdash;Broughton's <i>Concent
of Scripture</i>, and Sir John Harington's
<i>Ariosto</i>. The latter contains almost fifty plates,
closely copied from a Venetian edition, and
was the most ambitious book illustrated with
metal plates published in the century. There are
a few other books published before 1600 which
contain specimens of engraving, but none worthy
of particular mention.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
